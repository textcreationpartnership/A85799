            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T hath pleaſed the Powers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which the <hi>Doctor</hi> is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to breathe, to ſhut up his Tongue in ſilence, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the ſolemn way of interpreting and applying ſacred Writ: But he is not denyed the liberty to hold forth a Tranſcript of what he formerly taught and preach'd, as authoriz'd and aſsign'd to that great work by his high Calling. If thou conceive it comes abroad without the accuſtomed Verdure and Vigor, impute it to an unavoydable fatality: He hath been ſo worried, that 'tis much if any ſignal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of a ſtrengthn'd Underſtanding be left to know him by.</p>
            <p>Yet I am ſecur'd by unbyaſſed knowing
<pb facs="tcp:170448:3"/>Judgements, thou wilt, in this, finde veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, <hi>Afflictio dat Intellectum,</hi> his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold preſſures have improved and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Intellectuals, cauſing him to make <hi>Mary</hi> to take upon her <hi>Martha's</hi> duty, ſpeculative Knowledge to joyn hand in hand with practical and moral, whereby in enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining Chriſt, both chuſe the better part.</p>
            <p>He was loath to condemn it to obſcurity, or to leave it as a Poſthumous Iſſue, leſt a Collector of Manuſcripts, blundering on it, might produce it into light with a Nick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name,
<note place="margin">Nocte plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it tota.</note> ſince <hi>Bathyllus</hi> preſum'd to own that approved Diſtich, compoſed, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, by <hi>Virgil,</hi> his living contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary: Or leſt a <hi>Legerdemain Brachy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher</hi> might alter and diſguiſe it with a new-fangled Mode, and ſo vend it; as the Indigent deal with the ductile Limbs of their Younglings; firſt diſtort and cripple them; then expoſe them to publick view for a future Livelyhood. Another incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the publication, is to manifeſt the groſs ſcandal, raiſed by errant Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters, who groan it out to their ſeduced Proſelytes, that Chriſt (alas!) was not rightly known among us, till the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot and Horſemen of their <hi>Iſrael</hi> opened the way for his paſſage. And why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb facs="tcp:170448:3"/>ſo they feign, ſelf-preachers ſent from the Univerſities, not from God, filled the ears of the Court and Country with well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounding words, with neat delicate ſtreams of Wit and humane Learning, not ayming at the Souls health.</p>
            <p>If the thick Miſts and Clouds of Faction have not quite darkned their Right Eye, the inward of the Soul, herein, as in other of his unanimous fellow-ſervants Pulpit-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they may brightly behold the Lord of Glory reaching out his Golden Scepter of Grace and Mercy to the poor in Spirit; ſhaking his Iron Rod of Terrour and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to cruſh and beat down every high Imagination exalted againſt Obedience to his Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Here's no pillow ſown under the Elbow of a Court-Favorite, <hi>Blaſtus;</hi> a tempori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Orator, <hi>Tertullus;</hi> a popular Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanick, <hi>Demetrius,</hi> the turbulent Silver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith; or of any other ring-leading Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: But the purity of Evangelical Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, is carried on without conneceſſary quirks and quiddities, in a clear clean per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuity; unleſs they will have nothing plain, but what rankly ſavours of down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right rude uncouth ſlovenly Expreſsions. The chief points of each Sermon are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb facs="tcp:170448:4"/>heads of Chriſtian Doctrine. The Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Offices, the Sufferings and Death of Chriſt, his Precepts, Promiſes, and Threats, are zealouſly declared and preſſed home to the Conſcience, convincing the World of Sin, of Righteouſneſs and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Maligning Spirits may ſurmiſe the end of this Impreſsion to be whatſoever diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered Fancy may ſuggeſt: The true Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict, which I am to give in, is, if accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Author's ſupplications offered at the Throne of Grace, the Holy Ghoſt ſhall work ſo effectually with theſe his Indeavours, as to make them ſubſervient Inſtruments of reconciling any one to God in Chriſt; his intent or ſcope is accompliſhed, his joy, his glory and crown atchieved. He will be bold to ſay he hath well laboured in the Word and Doctrine, as a Workman that nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to be aſhamed; being aſſured, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the gracious promiſe, he ſhall have this inch, this minute of a toylſome time, out-weighed by the Eternity of bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>

            <p>Theſe words evidently branch themſelves into a Queſtion, an Anſwer, and a Reaſon.

            <p>Of theſe, and their <hi>ſubdivided</hi> particulars, in order.</p>
            <p>In the Queſtion you may obſerve the <hi>party</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:170448:6"/>asking, the <hi>manner,</hi> and the <hi>matter.</hi> The party asking is an <hi>Individuum vagum,</hi> a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain uncertain <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> one without a name, <hi>Then ſaid ONE unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When a <hi>Queſtion</hi> is ask'd of our Saviour, which carries ſome weight, or tends to need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtruction, the <hi>name</hi> of the <hi>Propoſer</hi> is regiſtred together with the propoſal. Thus <hi>John</hi> is on the file for asking, <hi>Art thou He that ſhould come?</hi> Matth. 11.3. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> is not forgot, for asking, <hi>Art thou the Chriſt?</hi> Matth. 26.63. <hi>Pilate</hi> is recorded, for asking, <hi>Art thou the King of the Jews?</hi> Matth. 27.11. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> is nor unmentioned, for asking, <hi>How a man could be born again?</hi> John 3. But this Queſtion in the Text being more curious then neceſſary, and tending to I know not what purpoſe, is ask'd by I know not whom; for he is not vouchſaf'd the grace of being name. No particular is ſpecified in holy <hi>writ,</hi> that made the <hi>Inter'gatory,</hi> or moved the <hi>Quaere.</hi> From whence I infer, that ſuch as pry into Gods <hi>ſecrets,</hi> are leſſe in his books then they that follow the duties commanded. For need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs curioſity of the brain, robs the heart of that intention, and devotion, which ought to be placed on matters more pertinent. Why ſhouldſt thou or I be inquiſitive after the <hi>number</hi> of thoſe ſhall be ſaved? It more concerns us to lay our hands on our own breaſts, to enquire ſtrictly whether we find in our hearts thoſe heavenly graces to which
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170448:6"/>God hath annexed his ſaving promiſes, the more to aſſure our ſelves that we are <hi>Chriſts,</hi> tranſlated out the power of <hi>darkneſs</hi> to his marvailous <hi>light.</hi> Be not then addicted to vain prating people, who, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 1 Tim. 6. <hi>Know nothing, but dote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout queſtions, and ſtrife of words,</hi> and things which have no pith in them, whereby ye can reap no profit, but <hi>whereof cometh envying, raylings, evil ſurmiſes, froward diſputations of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo from the perſon asking, I proceed to the manner, which in appearance is duty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; it begins with <hi>Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then ſaid one unto him, Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Lord</hi> is moſt precious, and holy; it ſounds well in godly conference: whenſoever it comes forth, it promiſeth a religious, and well-weighed ſpeech; and therefore it ought ſo to be placed, and uſed, that the matter may fitly become ſo high a <hi>Name.</hi> But yet we find that all curious no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties, and ſtrange reaches, howſoever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, and broached, are wrongfully entitled to Gods honour, that by his great <hi>Name</hi> they may get honour to themſelves. What vain phanſie, or project; what hereſie, or commotion, hath ever been ſet on foot without the pretence of <hi>Gods glory?</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times his <hi>Name</hi> is quoted impertinently in ſenſeleſs talk, which occaſions a cold re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his omnipreſent, though inviſible
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170448:7"/>Majeſty. Sometimes he is lewdly called on, which breeds offence. Sometimes he is prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for proſpering downright ſins, which in time he will puniſh: And the <hi>griping</hi> world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling will not ſtick to ſay that <hi>God</hi> hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bleſſed his eſtate. Not to run too far off, I do not think this queſtion in the Text of ſufficient piety to follow the Name <hi>Lord;</hi> which gives me occaſion to complain of this ſo ſpecious abuſe. <hi>You call me Lord, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and ſo I am,</hi> John 13. if then I be your Lord, where is your ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice? <hi>Not every one that ſaith unto me, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the will of my Father, which is in Heaven,</hi> Math. 7. Let <hi>Lord,</hi> and ſervice; more obedience, and leſs queſtioning, go together.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever the queſtion be, as what it is, we ſhall partly ſee anon, the formal, outward reverence of this <hi>Inquiſitor,</hi> ſerves well to convince ſome rude, undiſciplined Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who in moſt religious duties are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligent, undecent, and profane; who, when they ſpeak of <hi>God,</hi> yea when they ſpeak unto him, ſhew leſſe manners, (I cannot ſay reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion) then they would to an honeſt man. Firſt, coming into his houſe not reverently, as into a <hi>Kings</hi> chamber, but heedleſly, as into an <hi>Inne;</hi> then praying, or babling with a vagrant eye, with one knee, and one el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow, perhaps with a long ſide, leaning like a dead pourtraicture on a Tomb-ſtone. Let
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170448:7"/>ſuch learn of this <hi>Queſtioner</hi> to ſay <hi>Lord</hi> man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly.</p>
            <p>Now to the queſtion it ſelf, <hi>Are there few that are ſaved?</hi> Some have thought that after a certain revolution of date and puniſhment, all ſhall be ſaved. Some think juſt half; colouring their opinion, I cannot ſay proving it, with certain parabolical allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſemblances, which to them ſeem demonſtrations: As becauſe <hi>Iſaak</hi> had two ſons, one of whom God hated, and the other he loved: or becauſe two women ſhall be grinding at a mill, one taken, and the other left: or in regard Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid, As in <hi>Adam</hi> many are made ſinners, ſo in Chriſt many are made righteous, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. Or in conſideration that the right and left hand (on which all at laſt ſhall be rank'd) are both of a ſize; and ſo they <hi>part ſtakes</hi> betwixt heaven and hell. Theſe proofs need no anſwer.</p>
            <p>Some think a few only ſhall be ſaved, ſo few, that they can almoſt tell who they are. Theſe ſtile <hi>themſelves</hi> the <hi>beloved</hi> of God, his choſen, and dear children, drawing all Gods promiſes only to their own behoof, reprobating all others; and whatſoever is ſpoken againſt them, is ſpoken againſt <hi>God,</hi> Theſe are ſo ſelf-conceited, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Gods mercy to their own acquaintance. Thus the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> or they of <hi>Donatus</hi> party, ſo ſpiritually covetous, as if it would do them little good to ſit in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170448:8"/>unleſs they ſaw many a <hi>Dives</hi> in hell. Their arguments for their <hi>paucity</hi> are theſe, drawn from the words of our Saviour, firſt in a ſeeming parallel to my Text, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi> Again, in the 12. and 22 of St. Luke, <hi>Fear not, little flock, for it is your Fathers good pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi> And Matth. 22.14. <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> Now if the flock be little, and the number few, all they that follow any kind of <hi>Sect,</hi> think themſelves to be the only men. I conceive we ſhould like rather this opinion then any of the former, becauſe men prove it worſt by their lives. A modern <hi>Light</hi> holds forth a <hi>Tenet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Joſeph Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> Treat. of Chriſt triumph.</note> that the <hi>number</hi> of the <hi>Elect</hi> is not inferior to the damned; urging withal, that they who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſuch narrow conceptions of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Kingdom, as if it were open but to few, do not advance Gods Majeſty, but diminiſh it; not magnifie his goodneſs, but diſparage it.
<q>For in this rather (ſaith he) is the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God manifeſted, that when in <hi>juſtice</hi> he might have damned all, he deſtinated ſome to puniſhment, but more to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</q> And ſo thoſe Texts which tell us <hi>few</hi> are ſaved, and <hi>few</hi> find the way to eternal life; he refers not to the fewneſs of the <hi>Elect,</hi> but of believing <hi>Jews</hi> at Chriſts <hi>firſt</hi> coming to them; as if ſuch ſpeeches were directed only to the <hi>contemporary Jews,</hi> in regard in the ſecond verſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 'tis the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170448:8"/>reply of thoſe <hi>Jews, We have eaten and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets,</hi> as if that ſhould advantage them. Whereupon he gives this expoſition of my Text.</p>
            <p>You demand of me (ſaith Chriſt) whether few be ſaved, but I admoniſh you not to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle away time in ſuch queſtions, but let there be a holy Contention among you with all celerity to enter in at this <hi>door</hi> of my <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel;</hi> for the time is very ſhort in which you have a capacity of faith to obtain the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God. Now the remiſſneſs, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs of theſe <hi>Jewiſh</hi> people was ſo great, that few of them indeed did believe his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and thereby few at his firſt manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the fleſh did enter by the true gate, Chriſt Jeſus. In theſe diſcrepant applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſts anſwer here, I will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a neceſſity of belief on any. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the faithful, be they never ſo many, are few in reſpect of our Saviours bowels, who <hi>would that all ſhould be ſaved and come to the knowledg of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 2. or in reſpect <hi>a multitude of all Nations, which no man could number, ſtood before the Throne with Palms in their hands,</hi> Revel. 7. I leave it, as 'tis here, undecided. For what can this further my Salvation, to know how many elſe ſhall be ſaved? Hath our heavenly <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> but one bleſſing? Is not his houſe large enough? are there not many manſions? Such a needleſs enquiry is like many other
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170448:9"/>concerning Gods Counſel, as, What he did before he created the world, Where hell ſhall be: How mankind ſhould have encreaſed, and been diſpoſed, if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood in his innocency: Whether Gods decree be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, or conditional: When, and upon what conſiderations he elected: Whether there be <hi>Scientia media,</hi> a divine foreknowledge of future events upon ſuch conditions as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to paſs?</p>
            <p>There are a ſort of men who make it their only Religion to enquire of what Religion God himſelf is; who in ſtead of following their own duties, dive into the Office of God. Such is the knowledge which puffes up, and buts againſt love, which edifies. Such queſtions of ſupernatural <hi>Genealogies,</hi> or <hi>Genealogies</hi> of queſtions, be <hi>ſuperfooliſh;</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with them. So I haſten to the anſwer of our wiſe and bleſſed Saviour, <hi>He ſaid to them, Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt of the <hi>manner,</hi> then of the <hi>matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was but <hi>one</hi> propoſed the queſtion; Chriſt replies to the reſt who ſtood by, they being all concerned therein. Beſides, the <hi>manner</hi> of his anſwer is not direct to the <hi>quaere,</hi> which ſhews he did not much like it; but to the ground thereof. He anſwers like himſelf, who is even the <hi>Diſcerner</hi> of hearts, and can ſee to what concluſion the thought would bend. He that moved the queſtion, was haply touched with a ſpice of pride, rejoycing within himſelf that he of the few
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170448:9"/>was one, and taking delight in the excluſion of others. Otherwiſe, if many ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, he had a mind perchance to live idle, and ſecure, hoping to thruſt into heaven amidſt the multitude. Soft, our Saviour teacheth him his duty, that ſo he may be one of the few; and in ſtead of reſolving, gives him an anſwer like that which he gave to <hi>Peter,</hi> being inquiſitive about <hi>John, What's that to thee? follow thou me,</hi> John 21. Pleaſe not thy phanſie, whoſoever thou art, in reckoning thy ſelf one of the few; nor reſt ſecure, in counting upon many, but ſtrive thy ſelf, as thou art bid.</p>
            <p>It is the holy <hi>Ghoſt</hi>'s uſual method, in anſwering to impertinent queſtions, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at the end, and to render to prying ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation a <hi>precept</hi> for practiſe. So when the <hi>Herodians</hi> asked Chriſt <hi>whether it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to pay tribute to Caeſar;</hi> he refers them to the inſcription of the coyn, and bids them <hi>give to Caeſar the things that are Caeſars.</hi> Matth. 22. So when the <hi>Diſciples</hi> asked concerning the end of the world, he anſwers, <hi>Let no man deceive you,</hi> Matth. 24. When the queſtion aroſe, <hi>Who ſhould be the greateſt?</hi> He told them, <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe Lordſhip, but ye ſhall not do ſo,</hi> Luk. 22. Still their anſwer is their duty. But when duty is the queſtion, the anſwer is plain, and direct: As, when the people asked the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John, What ſhall we do? He that hath two coats, let him impart to him that hath none,</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:170448:10"/>Luk. 3.11. When the <hi>Publicans</hi> ask the fame, 'tis, <hi>Exact no more then what is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you,</hi> Luk. 3. When the Souldiers demand in like manner, ſo he anſwers, <hi>Do violence to no man, accuſe none falſly, be content with your wages,</hi> Luk. 3. 'Tis cleer, he prefers <hi>doing</hi> before <hi>diſputing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No doubt but our Saviour could have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered exactly to this queſtion in the Text, for he knows his own, all his <hi>Members</hi> are written in his <hi>book.</hi> If we by our <hi>Anatomy</hi> can reckon up all the parts, all the bones, the veines, the ſinews, and muſcles of the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body,
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.30.</note> Chriſt could ſurely tell all the <hi>Members</hi> of his myſtical body; yea and all the hairs on each of their heads. He ſpeaks plainly in the formentioned 7 Chapter of <hi>Matth.</hi> that thoſe which enter in at the narrow gate are but few: but here, to meet with a curious brain, with a proud or ſluggiſh heart, he conceales that anſwer, and puts off the Queſtioner with his duty: <hi>Strive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in at the narrow gate;</hi> which is the <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> now to be preſſed upon you.</p>
            <p>We may not think to get a place in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as we do a prize in a <hi>Lottery;</hi> firſt ask whether there be many, or few chances? then put in our hands, and draw our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. No, we muſt <hi>work out Salvation;</hi> it will coſt us labour, and ſweat, and ſtriving to extremity.</p>
            <p>The word in the Original is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Strive till ye fall into an agony,</hi> and ſweat as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170448:10"/>well in receiving redemption, as <hi>Chriſt</hi> did with giving it. For it coſt our <hi>Redeemer</hi> a combate with Satan, an Agony within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, a wreſtling with death, before he could ſet up the prize for us to run at. Wherefore we cannot do leſs then run, and thruſt hard when we come to the goal or gate. The Kingdom of Heaven is <hi>gotten by violence;</hi> we cannot obtain a bleſſing, unleſs with <hi>Jacob</hi> we wreſtle for it. And indeed, the word here is borrowed from Champions, or wreſtlers. Before the combate, incredible was the care and ſtrictneſs of temper in thoſe <hi>Olympian Agonists,</hi> who for certain months before, cleanſed their bodies with phyſick and diet, poyſed the condition of weather with helpes of art, wore their apparel by rule, had their bread weigh'd, their drink meaſured, their ſleep ſtinted, oftentimes breathing themſelves, and trying their abilities, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare way for victory. Can we do leſs in our ſpiritual courſe for an infinite prize, a crown immeaſurable, a Kingdom immortal? Then having phyſick'd your ſouls with the Cup of Chriſt, be ſure ye keep your ſelves clean and temperate. No beaſt, nor unclean thing might approach the Holy Mount on earth where the Law was given, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.3. How then ſhall men turn'd to beaſts by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, or worſe then beaſts, by ſtupefying and ſenſe-confounding exceſſe, be admitted into the Heavenly Mount, reſerved for the Children of Grace, who practiſe their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170448:11"/>ſtrength with chaſte good works, and examine their parts inwardly before the laſt ſtiffe wreſtling at heavens ſtrait gate?</p>
            <p>But what means this <hi>Metaphor</hi> of entring at the <hi>ſtrait</hi> gate? It ſhewes the difficulty of entrance; we muſt therefore uſe the ſame endeavour ſpiritually for admittance into Heaven, as we do corporally for entrance through a narrow paſſage, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> we muſt ſtoop, and leſſen our ſelves, by abating and caſting off all thoſe cumbrous impediments, which ſwell us up, and lets our ingredience. Such are theſe: <hi>pride,</hi> which advanceth the head; <hi>covetouſneſs,</hi> which buncheth the back; and <hi>intemperance,</hi> which blows up the belly. The man muſt be extenuated, and freed from all theſe incumbrances, that will get through this gate, which is therefore called <hi>narrow,</hi> becauſe vve muſt narrow our ſelves.</p>
            <p>The houſe of God on earth may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a reſemblance of his heavenly palace; for in moſt of our Churches the door we commonly enter in is low, and little; this anſwers to humility. None ſhould paſſe through with ſtuffe, or carriage; this anſwers to the baniſhing of vvorldlineſs. When vve come thither, vve uſe commonly to come cleanly, and faſting; this anſwers to chaſte and ſober temperance. Concerning the leſſening of our ſelves by humility, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath given the <hi>ſize</hi> of a little child for our meaſure; <hi>except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye ſhall not enter into
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170448:11"/>the heavenly Kingdom. Whoſever ſhall hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble himſelf as this little child, ſhall be greateſt,</hi> Matth. 18.</p>
            <p>Nothing hinders humility ſo much as pride of <hi>ſpirit,</hi> preſumption on God, or out ſelves: pride of <hi>dreſſing,</hi> or pride of prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, hinder too, but not ſo much. The one is a toy; the other the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> once had, and unlearned;
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> but pride of Spirit was proper to the <hi>Phariſee;</hi> without this, he might have entred in; for ſurely that Phariſaical Sect had more then ordinary righteouſneſs, but they loved to ſhew it, to boaſt, and ſtand upon it, and to condemn all others. This is a ſtiffe pride, and hard to be removed, becauſe they that have it applaud themſelves, and think they do vvell. This is the pride of <hi>Lucifer,</hi> vho appears as an Angel of <hi>Light;</hi> and they that have it, come very neer, yet cannot get through. Sometimes they can put in their heads by <hi>Speculation,</hi> but their backs vvill not bow, that their feet may come along. Sometimes a foot is in by <hi>practiſe;</hi> but while they keep their heads aloſt, and <hi>gaze</hi> on the myſteries of the ſtructure, they get a knock on the head, and fall back to the vvorld.</p>
            <p>Concerning <hi>abdication,</hi> or contempt of the vvorld, particularly of <hi>uncertain</hi> riches,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.17.</note> our Saviour hath ſaid, Matth. 19. <hi>It is hard for a rich man to enter in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<note place="margin">Matth. 19. v. 23.24. &amp; verſ. 14.</note> 'tis harder for him then for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle.</hi> On the contrary,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170448:12"/>make ye friends of the unrighteous Mammon,
<note place="margin">Luk. 16.9.</note> 
               <hi>that they may receive you into everlaſting ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>poor,</hi> which are in before, will give a hand unto you. They have told Chriſt of their friends on earth, and Chriſt takes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them. Wherefore the ſoul muſt be leſſen'd, and purged from all theſe groſs hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, and <hi>fardels</hi> of fleſhlineſs, otherwiſe the gate of Heaven, though wide enough for thouſands to enter at once, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it ſelf like a <hi>ſhut-purſe,</hi> and be found too narrow for one unreformed ſinner; yea, though that ſinner make a fair ſhew of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity by much religious diſpute, and ſearch of heavenly things; for, as it follows, <hi>many will ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Is not this our Saviours promiſe, <hi>Seek, and ye ſhall find; knock, it ſhall be opened?</hi> Matth. 7. How then can any that <hi>ſeek</hi> be denied entrance? Surely, becauſe they do not ſeek to the purpoſe, and after a right manner. They ſeek inquiſitively, not duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; rather to know the Secrets of God, then to fulfil his Commands: or perhaps they ſeek faintly, vvith a vvandring intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and careleſs ceſſation; if they find not preſently, they give over their ſearch; they may knock once, or twice on their breaſt, but ſoftly, <hi>as upon felt,</hi> and ſo give over be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be heard. Therefore the <hi>Apostle</hi> having ſaid in the third to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> and the firſt verſe, <gap reason="foreign">

Any other ſearch, vvhether by ſpeculation, talk, or queſtioning, is but formal, vain, and frivolous. For heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs enquirers ſeek entrance into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, as into a publick <hi>ſpectacle;</hi> thither they come, and make a profer; but ſeeing a thruſt at the door, away they paſs. The difficulty of obtaining, rebates the edge of endeavour.</p>
            <p>Such a <hi>Seeker</hi> was the young man in the Goſpel; he ſought indeed to enter, but how? by asking a queſtion, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> Matt. 19.16. <hi>Do</hi> vvas the beſt queſtion could be asked; yet little available, becauſe the anſwer vvas not followed; for having <hi>great poſſeſſions,</hi> and being told,

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:170448:13"/>vvherefore our Saviour puts the man to the <hi>Teſt,</hi> whether he loved God beſt of all, by a propoſal of forgoing that, vvhich vvas deareſt to him; vvhereunto if he had wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly condeſcended, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did to the ſacrificing of his only ſon, perhaps the <hi>will</hi> had been accepted inſteed of <hi>extream performance.</hi> But howſoever, he that loves any thing more then <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he that vvill not forſake Father or Mother, Wife or Child, Brother or Siſter, to gain him (wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Chriſt himſelf) is not worthy of him.
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.37.</note> Shall I ſay then, He that will not forſake his dear ſin, or rather, he that prefers Heaven it ſelf before Chriſt, is unworthy of him, and Heaven? You may hear <hi>God</hi> himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of theſe vain unſerviceable ſeekers, Iſa. 58.2. for indeed they are but hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſinners; <hi>They ſeek me daily, and delight to know my wayes, as a Nation that did righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinance of their God; they ask of me the Ordinance of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice:</hi> but what follows?

            <p>Be not then curious in enquiring what needs not, whether, or how many others ſhall be ſav'd: this is to be <hi>buſie-bodies,</hi> or, as the word originally imports, <hi>Biſhops in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other dioceſſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. which the ſame <hi>Peter</hi> would not have Chriſtians to be; but ſtrive earneſtly, and faithfully, to do what God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, that your ſelves may obtain ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

            <p>THE firſt Chapter records the <hi>Nativity</hi> of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">SERM. II.</note> now after his birth follows his <hi>life, the things that Jeſus began both to do, and teach;</hi> and theſe are no leſſe then Miracles, or words able to work them; but the vertue of every power is made moſt apparent by action, for which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the Evangeliſt in the 1 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> v. 1. hath placed our Saviours <hi>doing</hi> before his <hi>teaching:</hi> for unleſs his works had made way for his words, the peoples belief had come but ſlowly on. Mark then how holy Hiſtory hath regiſtred his Miracles from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. This <hi>BEGINNING of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>From which Record you may obſerve the <hi>Miracle</hi> it ſelf, it was the turning of <hi>water</hi> into <hi>wine;</hi> then the <hi>Circumſtances:</hi> 1. The <hi>Author,</hi> it was wrought by <hi>Jeſus.</hi> 2. The <hi>time,</hi> it was the firſt, or the <hi>BEGINNING</hi> of his Miracles. 3. The <hi>place,</hi> it was wrought in <hi>CANA</hi> of <hi>Galilee.</hi> Then the <hi>manner,</hi> it was glorious, for thereby he manifeſted forth <hi>his glory:</hi> and laſtly, the <hi>effect,</hi> which
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170448:14"/>was belief; <hi>his Diſciples BELIEVED on him.</hi> Of theſe in the order propoſed.</p>
            <p>The turning of wine into water is familiar amongſt us, but the turning of water into wine deſerves the name of a <hi>Miracle.</hi> 'Tis eaſie to make worſe of better, but not to make better of worſe: eaſie to ſpend, and waſt, but not to provide, and gather.</p>
            <p>But you may ſay, We find it common in Nature, that water ſoaking into the root of the tree, is turned into the <hi>blood</hi> of the grape, and ſo becomes wine; and, which is moſt difficult, that <hi>God</hi> himſelf ſhould convert water into wine, or cauſe <hi>a vine</hi> to do the ſame.</p>
            <p>Indeed every work of Nature, if duly conſidered, hath a greater expreſſion of power then a Miracle: 'Tis more to <hi>make</hi> an eye, then to <hi>cure</hi> the blinde; to <hi>frame</hi> a joynt, then to <hi>bid</hi> the lame walk; to <hi>ſcrue</hi> an ear, then to <hi>open</hi> the deafs hearing; or to <hi>mould</hi> a man out of nothing, then to <hi>raiſe</hi> the dead. Nevertheleſs, a vvork cut of ordinary courſe, though of leſs power, more takes our gazing <hi>wonder,</hi> becauſe leſs obvious. Ignorance mixt vvith ſome parcel of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, is the Mother of Wonder.</p>
            <p>Howſoever, vve are rightly taught hereby to magnifie God in all his works, vvhich vve daily behold; for there is more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent art in making the pooreſt bramble, or thiſtle, then in building the goodlieſt <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace</hi> of the earth; as <hi>Salomon in all his Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170448:15"/>was not apparelled like the Lily of the field,</hi> Matth. 6.</p>
            <p>Next, this urgeth us to uſe Gods Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures reverently, and temperately, becauſe it hath ſometimes coſt him a <hi>Miracle</hi> to call vvine out of vvater; yea, and vvater out of the rock. All the vvit of man cannot make a drop in time of neceſſity, nor procure by the friendſhip of <hi>Abraham</hi> the moiſtning of his <hi>tongue,</hi> Luk. 16. <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Magicians, <hi>Exo.</hi> 7. could turn vvater into blood, ſo can murtherers, and the deſtroyers of mankind, they can turn vvhole Rivers; but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert vvater into vvine, and make it fit for the uſe of man, this is the vvork of him that turns vvine <hi>Sacramentally</hi> into his own blood. <hi>God</hi> by turning and returning of vva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into vvine, and vvine into his own blood, hath double ſanctified the uſe thereof. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be He, who hath given us the ſame plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly to enjoy, and reverent <hi>be</hi> vve in uſing it decently.</p>
            <p>The quantity of vvater here changed by computation of the firkins vvhich the 6 pots held, vvas neer about two hogs-heads: The Miracle afforded no more at a great meeting, at a ſolemn marriage, where one Gueſt brought 13, or 14. in his company. For there was <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and his <hi>Mother,</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> From hence we may learn to propoſe a fit meaſure, both at the time of <hi>jollity,</hi> and ordinary <hi>refreſhing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This for the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of the Miracle; the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170448:15"/>
               <hi>circumſtance</hi> next following, is the <hi>Author</hi> Jeſus.</p>
            <p>That's the <hi>Son</hi> of God, and Saviour of Man, the Lord of Lords, and Head of all Powers; by his vvord all things were made, and by his vvord alone he could have ſoon converted, or confounded the vvhole world. Nevertheleſs ſuch as He vvas, he ſought to raiſe faith, and vvin obedience rather by his <hi>goodneſs,</hi> then by his <hi>greatneſs;</hi> not by his rod, but by a beneficial Miracle; that ſo the mighty may be brought to deſcend to the vveakneſs of their <hi>underlings</hi> by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious dealing. If they be <hi>heads,</hi> not to tread on their feet, but to tread with them, to ſhew and guide them, to move and direct them. If they be <hi>Maſters,</hi> to govern ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; if <hi>Fathers,</hi> to provide lovingly; if <hi>Teachers,</hi> to inſtruct mildly; if <hi>Rich,</hi> to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain charitably; to rule by example of vvorks, as well as by rigour of vvords; not ſo to load the back vvith juſtice, as to leave the belly empty of mercy; but after Gods <hi>Method,</hi> to joyn the <hi>rod</hi> and the <hi>ſtaffe</hi> in <hi>comforting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Jeſus</hi> being the Son of God, ſhew'd vvhoſe ſon he vvas by his work, a work far exceeding the skill of <hi>Carpentry,</hi> not forming the veſſel, but inriching it vvith liquor; his Father makes the <hi>vine,</hi> and he therefore the <hi>wine,</hi> vvhich iſſues from the vine.</p>
            <p>If you would demonſtrate your ſelves to be children of your heavenly Father, imitate
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170448:16"/>his vvorks, his goodneſs, his beneficence and mercy. Our <hi>Jeſus</hi> being the true <hi>Vine,</hi> John 15.22. preſented the fruit of the vine in this Miracle: Can you think to be branches of the ſame vine, not yielding fruits anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? <hi>Every tree that doth not bring forth good fruit, ſhall be hewn down, and caſt into the fire,</hi> Matth. 7.</p>
            <p>The next circumſtance is that of <hi>time.</hi> This was the firſt, the <hi>beginning</hi> of Chriſts Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. Was it ſo? I thought his very <hi>Incarnation</hi> had been the Miracle of all Miracles, the foundation of all the reſt. And ſo it vvas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; but this was the firſt <hi>outward</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, which he vvrought <hi>Extraſe,</hi> without, upon other Creatures. That <hi>the word was made fleſh,</hi> vvas the beginning of <hi>humiliation;</hi> but that <hi>water was turned into wine,</hi> was the beginning of <hi>Exaltation.</hi> That the <hi>word</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made fleſh was born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle <hi>abſolutely</hi> the firſt, this redounds to the honour of <hi>Virginity,</hi> vvhich whoſoever truly keeps, works a <hi>prime</hi> miracle on him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but that the <hi>word</hi> turn'd virgin-water into wine at a <hi>Wedding,</hi> the firſt <hi>outward</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, it redounds to the honour of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,</hi> which next to virginity is the moſt honourable eſtate.</p>
            <p>But vvhy was this the firſt <hi>outward</hi> Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle? You may ſuppoſe theſe reaſons.</p>
            <p>The coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was tidings of joy,
<note place="margin">Luk. 2.</note> of <hi>great joy, which ſhould be to all people;</hi> therefore a Miracle of Wine, whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170448:16"/>is to make <hi>glad</hi> the heart of man, was a fit entrance to begin this time of joy. For indeed, if we <hi>dive</hi> into the myſtical ſenſe, this turning of water into wine, is the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of tears into joy at the marriage of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, This beginning ſuits well with the order and progreſs of Chriſts Miracles: firſt, you ſee he begins with change of the Creatures made for the uſe of man: then he proceeds to the change of mans body; as you have heard how he made the dumb to ſpeak, the blind to ſee, and the lame to walk; then in the laſt rank of Miracles he changeth <hi>the ſoul,</hi> both by effuſion of his blood, and infuſion of his ſpirit.</p>
            <p>All that I ſhall here apply is this: Firſt, that the thought hereof be entertained with joy, and thankfulneſs. Secondly, that we anſwer this beginning of Chriſts Miracles with ſome anſwerable beginning in our ſelves concerning the Creatures: For the turning of water into wine, let us begin a <hi>Counter-miracle,</hi> turn wine into water, the exceſs of it into tears of repentance, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe into the uſe of ſobriety; then vve may find in the next turn the form of the body to be vvonderfully chang'd, the dumb in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſenſe vvill be inabled to ſpeak, the deaf to hear, the blind to ſee, and the lame to vvalk. Then at laſt vve may attain to the greateſt change of the ſoul, by renewing the <hi>Image</hi> of Chriſt, by proceeding from igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170448:17"/>to knowledge, from unrighteouſneſs to righteouſneſs, from profaneſs to holineſs, daily growing up from grace to grace till we end in glory. Now having meaſured the circumſtance of <hi>time,</hi> I arrive to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of <hi>place,</hi> which is <hi>Cana of Galilee. This beginning of Miracles did Jeſus in Cana of Galilee.</hi>

Thus under the name of the place, is couch'd the condition, which belongs to the people of God, <hi>zeale</hi> after converſion. <hi>Hearken to me ye that ſeek the Lord; look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the rock whence ye are hewn, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digg'd,</hi> Eſay 51.1. even to the Lord your <hi>Maker</hi> and <hi>Redeemer;</hi> look unto him, and turn unto him with zeale of ſervice: <hi>Yeeld your ſelves unto him, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as weapons of righteouſneſs unto God. Know you not, whoſe ſervants you are, him ye obey? as therefore ye have yielded your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants to uncleanneſs, and to iniquity unto iniquity; even ſo now yield your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſervants to righteouſneſs unto holineſs,</hi> Rom. 6. The heart of a zealous convert is a fit ſeat for Chriſt to begin Miracles. <hi>Galilee</hi> in the 4. of St. <hi>Matth.</hi> and originally in the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170448:17"/>9 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> is called <hi>Galilee of the Gentiles,</hi> becauſe it ſtood on the confines, bordering upon them; and in regard of the <hi>Babylonian</hi> captivity, it was mixt with the Gentiles.</p>
            <p>And ſurely the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may well labour in zeal, and conform themſelves to the name of <hi>Cana,</hi> it ſhall well become them: for God hath eſtranged himſelf from the <hi>Jews,</hi> and ſent ſalvation upon the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to this purpoſe, that by them he might <hi>provoke the Jews to jealouſie,</hi> Rom. 11.11. And ſo ſaith God himſelf, <hi>I will move them to jealouſie with thoſe which are not a people; I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to anger with a fooliſh Nation,</hi> Deut. 32.21. Such were all the Gentiles, not a people, but <hi>fooliſh</hi> Nations; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a confuſed multitude, before Chriſt reduced them to order, by working Miracles. But now the propheſie of <hi>Eſay</hi> began to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>I am ſought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them that ſought me not: I ſaid, Behold me, behold me, to a Nation that was not called by my name,</hi> Eſay 65. and v. 1. And why? becauſe, as it follows, <hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day long to a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore it concerns us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom God hath revealed himſelf, to be zealous, and emulous in holy duties, as well to excite the Jews, as alſo to confirm our own election: If <hi>the branches were broken off, that we the wild Olives might be grafted in the true vine;</hi> know, that <hi>becauſe of unbelief
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170448:18"/>they were broken off, and that thou ſtandeſt by faith: Be not high-minded, but fear; for if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee,</hi> Rom. 11.19.</p>
            <p>We <hi>Gentiles</hi> were formerly but as <hi>dogs,</hi> unworthy to <hi>lick up the crums that fell from the childrens table,</hi> Matth. 15. and yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the <hi>children</hi> are diſcarded, and the <hi>ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> is left to us. Let us not then <hi>like dogs return to our vomit,</hi> preferring uncleanneſs before the myſtery of holineſs, and loſing the reliſh of heavenly food for droſs and filth. Take heed, ye that condemn the <hi>Jews</hi> for crucifying our Saviour, leſt ye do worſe, by making his paſſion, and the riches of his mercy, to be of no effect.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable how <hi>Jeſus,</hi> being the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of all, divided his preſence, and the means of Salvation, betwixt the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile.</hi> He was born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> in Jewry, but he lived at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> at <hi>Cana,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum</hi> of Galilee: he ſuffered death at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> but being riſen again, he went into <hi>Galilee,</hi> to declare his reſurrection, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.7. The <hi>Jews</hi> had the cuſtody of Divine Oracles, they had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> more worthy of belief then one ſent from the dead, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. The Gentiles had onely the book of <hi>Nature;</hi> therefore at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> Chriſt taught in the Temple, but in <hi>Galilee</hi> he wrought Miracles: there he beſtowed his words, as to men of more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and here his works, as to men
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170448:18"/>of groſſer capacity; there faith was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by the <hi>ear,</hi> and here a door was open'd by the <hi>eye.</hi> To either place our common Saviour was not defective, but applied means of converſion moſt anſwerable to both. Thus the <hi>Corner-ſtone</hi> lay in the <hi>midſt</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both ſide-walls, the <hi>Jews,</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> the ſame <hi>Mediator,</hi> who joyned <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> in one <hi>Perſon,</hi> Heaven and Earth in one league, ſought alſo to joyn the <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> in one Church. Thus like the <hi>Sun</hi> he illuſtrates both <hi>hemiſpheres,</hi> and ſo divides his courſe, that the whole world may be cheriſhed by his beames.</p>
            <p>Now for our parts, we have the <hi>means</hi> of converſion vouchſafed to both; we have the words which he preached at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> we have the <hi>works</hi> he wrought in <hi>Galilee;</hi> and we know the truth of them as well as moſt of the Inhabitants of <hi>Cana;</hi> for all were not preſent, the greater part were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with Relation: Then what hinders our belief? and if we believe, what hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders our duty? Let us <hi>ſhew our faith by our works,</hi> by obedient conformity to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, and by newneſs of life.</p>
            <p>Obſerve further, that <hi>Galilee</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eſteem of the Jews, and was accounted a place from whence <hi>no good could ever come.</hi> Likewiſe <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> thought to diſgrace Chriſtians, by calling our Saviour himſelf, and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, by the name of <hi>Galileans.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170448:19"/>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who came to relieve the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed, and to raiſe the lowly, honoured this <hi>place</hi> with the <hi>firſt</hi> of his Miracles. This teacheth us neither to deſpiſe others, nor to deſpair of our ſelves, be the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition never ſo poor, and low. When <hi>God</hi> ſeems to be fartheſt off, even then he is neereſt at hand, as loving to ſhew his ſtrength in weakneſs, his mercy in miſery. Though <hi>Cana</hi> doth likewiſe ſignifie <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>reed</hi> ſhaken with wind, yet let us raiſe our meditations with this, that the <hi>reed</hi> ſtands up, when the ſturdy <hi>oke</hi> is thrown to the ground. In ſuch preſervation, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, the glory of God appears moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. So I proceed to the glorious manner of working this Miracle: He <hi>manifeſted</hi> forth his glory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Glory</hi> is the excellence of Majeſty, the light and luſtre of ſurpaſſing vertue, and therefore moſt proper to <hi>God,</hi> the fountain of all vertue and power. Such brightneſſe cannot be concealed: the <hi>cloud</hi> of humane fleſh, and form of humility, wherein the Godhead of Chriſt was clothed, could not long obſcure his Majeſty, but upon occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons it muſt needs break forth. They are his own words, <hi>No man puts a light under a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhel;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 11.33.</note> the true <hi>Light,</hi> which lightens every man into the world, begins at length to diſplay his beams.</p>
            <p>And becauſe <hi>glory</hi> is no private object, but conſpicuous to publique view, therefore
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170448:19"/>our Saviour took <hi>this time</hi> for his Miracle, when a numerous aſſembly were met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at a <hi>Marriage</hi>-feaſt. The <hi>Sun</hi> was not made for the eye of a ſingle Spectator; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons muſt not expect a Miracle for perſonal reaſons, or private reſpects, but content themſelves with the general courſe of <hi>providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if the <hi>manner</hi> of the Miracle be rightly conſidered, this work, this beginning of Miracles, did moſt gloriouſly declare the power of his <hi>God-head.</hi> For by his own Command, without any borrowed power, the ſame word, which made the Elements, was able to turn and change them how he liſt: yea, without a word ſpoken, his will was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient; the ſubſtance created by him, felt his <hi>influence,</hi> and obeyed. For we find nothing ſpoken to the <hi>water,</hi> but onely this to the ſervants, <hi>Fill the water-pots, and now draw forth.</hi> None could do this in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but God himſelf.</p>
            <p>Now to apply theſe obſervations; 'tis ſaid, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. That the glory which ſhone on <hi>Moſes,</hi> made the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſhine; the <hi>light,</hi> which is darted on the wall, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the wall to reflect a ſecond light. It is then our duty, ſince the glory of Chriſt and his Goſpel is riſen upon us, to manifeſt the ſame by actions of light, according to that of the Prophet, <hi>Ariſe, ſhine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee,</hi> Eſay 60.1. Weak as we are, we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170448:20"/>have a way of manifeſting Gods glory too, even by good works; Let your <hi>light</hi> ſo <hi>ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 5. The <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Original</hi> may be conveyed hither and thither by ſeveral glaſſes; <hi>Chriſt</hi> bears the Image of his <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and we of Chriſt; a Chriſtians good life is the <hi>reflex</hi> of Gods glory, which we muſt endeavour to manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt preſented his Miracle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>multitude,</hi> ſo muſt our good be <hi>diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive,</hi> ready to be extended to many, even as many as occaſion ſhall require, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity will permit. The <hi>Sun</hi> is not exhauſted by caſting his beams on every ſide: no more ſhould we grow weary of diffuſing righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs on every <hi>object,</hi> both by deed, and example. The <hi>ſtock</hi> of vertue is ever increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſpending.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, ſince <hi>God</hi> is the ſole <hi>worker</hi> of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and <hi>glory</hi> is his peculiar, which <hi>He will not give to another,</hi> we ought nor to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate the leaſt beam thereof to our ſelves in any of our works, but to attribute the whole to God, the prime Author of all. For where is the wine of the veſſel without the vine, the water of the Conduit without the Spring; or the ſhining of the wall without the light of Heaven? <hi>Herod</hi> after his rich decking of rayment, and language, was ſtruck by a hand inviſible, and eaten up with worms, becauſe when the people heap'd
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170448:20"/>upon him divine applauſe, he gave not the praiſe to God, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. <hi>Not unto us,
<note place="margin">Act. 12.</note> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, O Lord, but to thy Name be glory for evermore.</hi> I now come to my laſt point, the <hi>effect</hi> of this miracle: His diſciples <hi>believed</hi> on him.</p>
            <p>Miracles, and belief are mutual <hi>Relatives,</hi> eying each other as the cauſe and the effect: ſo that Miracles are for belief, as the cauſe for the end; and readineſs of belief invites Miracles, as the end draws on the cauſe: <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs you ſee wonders,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ye will not believe,</hi> Joh. 4. Theſe are the moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual works of faith; &amp; on the other ſide, <hi>ſaid I not unto thee, that if thou wouldſt believe, thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> So he ſpeaks to <hi>Martha</hi> about the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Joh. 11.40. <hi>Neceſſary</hi> Miracles are never wanting to confirm belief. Human Nature in this depraved condition, is nothing ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of truth, as it is greedy of good, and regardful of power; from whence it comes, that <hi>hearing</hi> of Gods word is leſs ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king then <hi>ſeeing</hi> of his works; eſpecially with men of hard hearts, and dull capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>A wicked and adulterous Generation, is altogether ſet upon ſignes. What ſign ſhewest thou?</hi>
               <note place="margin">v. 18.</note> is frequent in the mouth of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jew, though beſt acquainted with divine Oracles. But how came Chriſts own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be of this condition? you muſt have them excuſed, becauſe they were ſimple and ignorant men, newly taken up by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170448:21"/>in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and had not been long with their <hi>Maſter.</hi> Wherefore our <hi>Saviour</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his continual goodneſs deſcends to humane infirmity, and initiates the faith of his Church vvith Miracles. And I dare ſay that Miracles are not yet ſo ceaſed, but even to this day, if the <hi>Goſpel</hi> were now to be planted in a place where it hath not been already rejected, <hi>God</hi> would hearken to the voice of his <hi>Agent,</hi> and confirm his words vvith ſignes from Heaven.</p>
            <p>Since then we know by our ſelves what is moſt prevalent in the converſion of a ſinner, or unbeliever, let us be ready to afford that to others, which our ſelves have ſometimes needed: Let us imitate the <hi>method</hi> of Chriſt; and though we cannot turn our brethren by ſhewing Miracles, let us come as neer as vve can, and ſecond good words vvith <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary</hi> good works.</p>
            <p>This is the way to be <hi>Sub-ſaviours, Petty Mediators,</hi> and <hi>Factors</hi> for Chriſt. Then the Lords <hi>Miniſter</hi> beſt follows the Text, vvhen his life comments upon his Doctrine, and makes a <hi>viſible</hi> repetition at home of vvhat he delivered in the Church. Likewiſe vvorks are honeſt <hi>Laymens</hi> Sermons, they preach vvith their hands, and not with their tongues,, and by the plenty of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there lies a tongue in every finger.</p>
            <p>It was the Caveat of the bleſſed Mother, to the ſervants of this feaſt, <hi>Whatſoever he ſaith unto you, do it.</hi> And it ſhall be mine
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170448:21"/>to you; See that ye do what our Saviour commandeth, that ſo ye may keep the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual feaſt of a good conſcience, and find the water of tears and heavineſs, turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wine of joy and gladneſs; which may never be conſumed, but laſt like the widows oyl, till ye come to the place of joy everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; vvhither God of his mercy bring us, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. Amen.</p>

               </gap>, <hi>a Word of Comfort,</hi> becauſe it treats of a wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com Subject, our delivery from the bonds of ſin.

               </gap>, this il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative <hi>For</hi> here in this Text, ſhewes (as anon ſhall be proved) that her love was the effect, not the cauſe of her forgiveneſs. And ſo I divide the whole into <hi>a benefit,</hi> and a <hi>thanksgiving.

In the thankſgiving, you may be pleaſed to obſerve in what the ſubſtance of her thanks did conſiſt, it was in Love; <hi>For ſhe Loved:</hi> Then the degree and meaſure thereof: it was no faint, no perfunctory affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; it was fervent, and exuberant, ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved <hi>much.</hi> But in the firſt place, the matter of the benefit requires my narration, and craves your patience. <hi>HER SINS are forgiven HER.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Forgiveneſs of ſin is the greateſt boon the miſerable man can obtain, becauſe none can beſtow it but he, who is the abſolute Benefactor in mans Salvation. As for us, we are all crazed and crippled in our fall in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170448:23"/>
               <hi>Adam;</hi> and how can one cripple help an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other? We then received ſuch a crack, that none can new-caſt us, and reſtore us to our primitive integrity, but <hi>he</hi> that firſt moulded us. Our wound admits ſuch infinite dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that it requires an infinite Redeemer to prepare a ſufficient playſter. The Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reſtrains this prerogative as proper and peculiar to his own throne, placing it as the moſt eminent of all his titles, and eſteeming it the chiefeſt <hi>Flower</hi> of his Crown. When <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſupplicate that he would daign him that honour as to ſhew him his <hi>Glory, I will ſhew thee my Excellency,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. And what is it? even his grace, mercy, and bounty. In the next chapter He is proclaimed <hi>JEHOVAH, gracious, merciful, rich in kindneſs, forgiving INI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Q<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ITY, TRANSGRESSION, and SIN.</hi> He inſiſts upon it, as delighting therein; and expreſſeth it with a treble em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, forgiving <hi>iniquity, tranſgreſſion,</hi> and <hi>ſin;</hi> that no obliquity, whether in thought, word, or deed, may ſeem to eſcape the bounds of his Royalty. <hi>Rich in kindneſs,</hi> as if the riches of his grace were in this one Act above others moſt diffuſed. And indeed we find it ſo: for his mercy, whoſe object is our iniquity, outſhines all his works. His Omnipotency demonſtrates him to be an awful God, his mercy exhibits him an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent Father, and that encourageth us to tread within his Courts, and to approach
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170448:23"/>near his preſence. <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles us to a higher eſtate then we were firſt born to; for by our <hi>Creation</hi> we were but men; by our <hi>Remiſſion</hi> we become <hi>Saints.</hi> And ſo happy we, that have been once wretched; Hence is it that 'tis the task, the ſcope, the whole buſineſs of a Chriſtian: we cannot well live vvithout daily food, far leſs can we live without daily forgiveneſs. And therefore our Saviour, who in the one Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion taught us to pray, <hi>Give us this day our DAILY BREAD;</hi> in the very next he inſtructs alſo to ask, and <hi>FORGIVE us our treſpaſſes.</hi> The Angels are Creatures more excellent then our ſelves in Nature; and yet by this boon of forgiveneſs, we far ſurpaſſe ſome of them in condition. For they having neither Devil without, nor fleſh at home to ſeduce them, vvhen they once fell, fell eternally, being not ſo much as vouchſafed that ſmall courteſie to be pitied. But man having his innocence ſtoln from him, and his overthrow occaſioned by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>others treaſon, the Son of God was moved in compaſſion to come down into the world; and not only ſo, but to lay down his own life at the ſtake for the life of man, vvhich was forfeited. He was ſo zealous of our remiſſion, that when our many ſins like ſo many talents of Lead had ſunk us deep as hell it ſelf, he then ſtript himſelf of his robes of Majeſty, and caſt himſelf into the <hi>Main,</hi> to raiſe us up again. I have heard 'tis the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170448:24"/>of the Court to chaſtiſe the faults of Princes in their <hi>Pages,</hi> whom they beſt love, that by ſmarting for their offences in their other ſelves, they may the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly amend them in their own ſelves. But here the <hi>Prince</hi> himſelf, the only Son and Heir of the celeſtial <hi>Diademe,</hi> endures the diſcipline of the <hi>laſh,</hi> that his ſervants, his bond-ſlaves, may be forgiven.</p>
            <p>Methinks we ſhould be no leſs affected herewith, then <hi>Naaman</hi> vvas, when <hi>Eliſha</hi> healed him of the leprous diſeaſe that cloth'd his body.
<note place="margin">2 Kin. 5.</note> For when he felt his <hi>fleſh to come again like the fleſh of a child,</hi> as the Text phraſeth it, he devoutly honoured the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet as a <hi>Father,</hi> and rejoyced at his ſecond nativity. Greater reaſon have we to feed our ſelves with true joy, and to magnifie the God of Iſrael, who cleanſeth our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed ſouls from a fouler leproſie, healing our old ſoares by forgiving our ſins paſt: and the better to keep us clean, the ſink being thus emptied, he inſtils into our hearts more ſoveraign Spirits, that ſo we may be ſecured not only from a preſent, but a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture danger. Neither doth this gracious dealing derogate from his juſtice; for though his Edict be out againſt ſin, yet it doth not ſo bind his hands that he cannot ſeal a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. He that tranſgreſſeth a Kings Law by <hi>Felony,</hi> is to fulfil the Law in the penalty of death. And yet the King, vvho ratifies the Laws validity, can ſoften, and take off,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:170448:24"/>as he pleaſeth, the edge and rigor of thoſe Lawes, to which he puts the <hi>Fiat</hi> for their conſtitution. Neither is punctual execution eſſential to the Law, but the power of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. If Soveraign Powers may lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly uſe their liberty in freeing of Delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents; much more may the King of Kings diſpenſe with his own Ordinance. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of his revenging juſtice ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not from the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of his Nature, but from his <hi>voluntary</hi> diſpoſition; He being <hi>Agens Liberrimum.</hi> And though ſin, as ſin, hath an outward diſ-agreement, and be evil in it ſelf, yet it hath no inward repugnan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, it is not abſolutely evil to the Almighty, in as much as he is not the worſe for the being of it, but is able, were he pleas'd to ſhew his power, to turn it to his Glory. Be not then diſmayed in regard of the vaſt dimenſions of thy numerous ſins. Saint <hi>John</hi> in his firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, and firſt chapter, certifies us, that <hi>the blood of Chriſt doth cleanſe us from ALL our ſins;</hi> and ſo are not able to ſhut out a good heart from God, which can but gaſpe for mercy as a dry land doth where no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is. He caſt out of this convert in the Text, ſeven devils as eaſie as one, and ſo he cancelled with the ſame facility her greateſt bonds, as he did her ſmalleſt bills.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge the Devil to be chained to everlaſting torments; yet not ſo much for his many ſins, as for his continuance therein, for his abode and dwelling in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:170448:25"/>thoſe tents of <hi>Kedar.</hi> If it were poſſible he could break off that accurſed league, his chains vvould be diſſolved, and himſelf <hi>Fixed into a Saint.</hi> It is well obſerved how our Saviour was contented to deſcend according to the fleſh, as vvell of <hi>Rahab</hi> a Harlot, <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi> an inceſtuous perſon, as of the holy Patriarks; that vvhere ſin did abound, grace might overflow. This one inſtance, <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> may ſerve for all, vvhoſe many and manifold ſins were quite forgiven.</p>
            <p>Touching the perſon of this ſinner, ſhe vvas indeed a Noble Woman;
<note place="margin">Magdale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalo Caſtro.</note> but vertue is not entailed to deſcent; it doth not ſtill run in a blood: hers was corrupted, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more noted for the eminency of vice, then of parentage. In plain terms, ſhe was <hi>Proſtibulum,</hi> an unchaſt Lady, a common Curteſan:
<note place="margin">Conſueverat Peccatrix appellari.</note> Her uſual appellation was <hi>Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trix, Mary the Sinner;</hi> all her ſenſes and affections wholly taken up with pernitious pleaſures.

And yet behold a ſtrange alteration! this ſtrayed ſheep is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, this prodigal child reclaimed; <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> hath eſcaped as a bird out of the ſnare of the fowler, ſhe hath diſlodged that

            <p>Where are now thoſe Barbarians, that will cenſure Saint. <hi>Paul</hi> a Murtherer,
<note place="margin">Act. 28.</note> if the Viper be not ſpeedily ſhaken from his Hands? Where are the Phariſaical Spirits, that will paſs their judgment upon any ſoul but their own? a crooked Plant is not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be broken, it may be ſtraightned for a better uſe: <hi>He runs far, that never turns.</hi> God hath his own times and hours, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for the Converſion of a Sinner; and ſo it becomes not us altogether to condemn any man, ſeeing there's hope of every ones Forgiveneſs, whoſe Repentance is not yet cut off by Death.

            <p>I ſpeak not this to encourage ſecure <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertines,</hi> who feel no remorſe for their Sins, leaving Repentance to their Death-bed: To ſuch as theſe, I muſt tell another Tale. An account that is long over-paſt, in the end becomes difficult to be finiſhed: Even ſo it will be with him, who wilfully ſuffers his debt of Sin to multiply, and the reckoning of his Tranſgreſſions to run on; in the end, his own wickedneſs ſhall reprove him. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremiah, ſhall draw him out of his lurking holes, and preſent him naked to Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:170448:26"/>And then with what confuſion and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhment ſhall he that was prodigal of the time of Grace,
<note place="margin">Chap. 2.</note> come forward unto judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? My intent, by propoſing the <hi>Pattern</hi> of this Convert, is onely to ſtrengthen the bruiſed Reed, whoſe humbl'd ſpirit trembles at God's Indignation. Firſt then, ſhew me <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s Confeſſion, her hearty Contrition; make it appear, that thy ſoul is furniſhed with her Grace, that thy Love to Chriſt is ſteady and unfeined; and then my ſoul for thy ſafety, I dare ſecure thee of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. And ſo we are brought directly to this Inference, <hi>For ſhe loved much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Particle <hi>for,</hi> doth not infer that her love to Chriſt was the cauſe of her forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but that it was a certain proof and ſigne of her pardon, <hi>becauſe,</hi> or, <hi>in that,</hi> ſhe loved much: the words immediately following in the Verſe, make the meaſure or degree of our love to Chriſt, to ariſe from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his gracious Remiſſion towards us. <hi>To whom little is remitted,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>he loves little;</hi> and ſo <hi>to whom much is forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, he loveth much.</hi> The forgiveneſs of her Sins going before her love, muſt needs be the cauſe of her Love; and not her Love the cauſe of her forgiveneſs. The ſame is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Parable or Similitude of the two Debtors, from the 40 to the 43 Verſe, where 'tis ſet down, that abundance of Love in the greateſt debtor, proceeded as an effect of the greater ſum forgiven by the Creditor. The
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:170448:26"/>ambiguous Inference thus explained, we may learn from this happy ſoul, how to place our Love aright; not on ſome poor Creature, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be ſought, inſufficient if obtain'd; but upon the greateſt, wiſeſt, beſt, and faireſt Object, even upon the Lord our God, whereby we enjoy all Joy for ever by meer loving.</p>
            <p>The Nature and Property of Love, may be expreſſ'd in this Breviary: <hi>Love</hi> is the imperious Soveraign of Affections, yea, the ſum of them, they are all reduced to it: For <hi>Love,</hi> when it <hi>longs</hi> for the thing loved, is then <hi>deſire;</hi> when it hath the thing loved, it is then <hi>joy;</hi> when it flies from that it affects not, then 'tis <hi>fear;</hi> and when it feels what it not deſires, it is <hi>ſadneſs.</hi> Thus all the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Deſire, Joy, Fear, and Grief, are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Love. So then, if we love God, we will deſire to enjoy him; and having enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, we will rejoyce to keep him; and feeling him to leave us, we will grieve at his abſence. Again, <hi>Love</hi> is ſo tranſcendent, that it ſpeaks with the tongue of every Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: <hi>Bounty</hi> is <hi>Love,</hi> as it is beneficial to the Indigent; <hi>Grace</hi> is <hi>Love,</hi> as it gives good things freely. Our Saviour makes <hi>Love</hi> the <hi>Cognizance</hi> of his Diſciples; the Apoſtle ſtiles it The <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of the Law, and <hi>bond of perfection,</hi> which linketh us to God, and God to us: we are far from him, if we love him not; with him, if we love him: <hi>Animus eſt ubi amat, non ubi animat;</hi> the ſoul being more where it likes, then where
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:170448:27"/>it lodgeth; rather where it loves, then where it lives. We finde, in the Hiſtory of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious <hi>Penitent,</hi> that Love acquitted her thanks to God, diſcharged her reckoning, ſanctified her actions, and covered a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Faults.</p>
            <p>But becauſe Love generally delivered, doth not illuſtrate how ſhe particularly loved, we will draw cloſer to the Point, and try her Deeds by the <hi>Symptomes</hi> and Properties of true Sincerity; that ſo it may appear her words were not ſmooth and counterfeit, but the truſty Meſſengers of her ſetled Affection to her Saviour.</p>
            <p>The firſt property of Love, is a fervent and longing deſire to enjoy that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved.</p>
            <p>This firſt Step we may trace in her timely haſting to the Tomb, where when ſhe found her Lord removed, every part of her became an Eye; and every thought, a look. Indeed, <hi>Peter,</hi> the Diſciple that is ſaid to love Chriſt beſt, and <hi>John,</hi> the Diſciple beſt beloved of the Lord, ran too; but their Devotion was ſooner out of breath. For when they had ſeen what ſhe had ſaid, they ſtaid not, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly retired, and ſhrunk away. She ſtands to it; her diſconſolate heart ſtill throbbing and panting, ſighing and enquiring until ſhe found him, whom her zealous ſoul moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired. Neither was this thirſt of his preſence deſcryed onely in her early viſits at his Grave where he lay, but it was diſcovered alſo in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170448:27"/>her former intruſion into the Phariſee's houſe, where he ſate at repaſt. She would not expect his coming forth, as knowing nice Ceremonies of behaviour to ſavour more of the <hi>Courtier</hi> then of the <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> Theſe aiery and windy Circumſtances of worldly carriage, oft-times withſtand the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid purchaſe of the Soul, and quencheth the alacrity of the Spirit. And ſo the importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Demeanour of this bold, yet religious Gueſt, received not a check, but a welcome. We cannot be unſeaſonable in preſſing our Redeemer <hi>at mid-night, before the morning-watch;</hi> he <hi>neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> We may approach neer him at the very Table; it is <hi>his meat,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John,
<note place="margin">Joh. 4.34.</note> to do the will of him that ſent him.</hi> And yet her approach was humble; ſhe came quivering behind him, who ſaw her well enough;
<note place="margin">Exod. 33.</note> accounting it with <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> grace abundant to <hi>ſee the back parts of God's Glory.</hi> She looked not ſo high as his hands, but in decent obeyſance fell at his feet, as reſolving now to tread wholly in her Saviours ſteps.</p>
            <p>Learn then out of this Property of Love, to crave no other ſolace of Chriſt, but Chriſt himſelf, in whoſe preſence is fulneſs of joy. Away with all dulneſs and coldneſs in God's Worſhip; <hi>Maries</hi> fervour is the beſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. For he that is all Spirit, will not take pleaſure in the drowzie and heavy Service of a Sluggard. Why did he ordain the neck of the conſecrated Aſſe to be broken, rather
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170448:28"/>then offered up in Sacrifice? Was it not to intimate, That he cannot brook our heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and tardineſs in ſerving him, of which the Aſſe hath ever been a <hi>Hieroglyphick?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond Property of LOVE, is a quick obedience, and forward care to follow Chriſt. Her ſpeedy renovation was a lively expreſſion of this ſprightly quality. <hi>A Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bete Phiala,</hi> of a Cauldron ſeething and boyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with luſt, ſhe became a Chriſtal Vial of pure Chaſtity. <hi>Quot membra, tot holocauſta;</hi> every member that before ſerved Sin, is now turned a holocauſt, a ſweet burnt Sacrifice. And that her Zeal within might want no pregnant ſignes without, the fire of her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion melts her ſoul into floods of water, like a flaſh of lightning ſeconded with a ſtorm of rain, as if ſhe mean'd to overwhelm her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in her own ſalt Sea of Tears. Her heart, vvhich before her Converſion vvas the Fountain of miſchief, returns her now a Medicine; and her eye, vvhich let in vanity, lets it out again, by making her Tears as it vvere, a ſecond <hi>Font,</hi> vvherein ſhe vvas renewed from the guilt of her Offences. And having proſtrated her ſelf at Chriſts feet, ſhe delights in kiſſing them; her kiſſes being holy Interpreters of her devout acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it vvas his feet vvhich guided her in the vvay of peace. The better to declare how ſhe held nothing too good in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſo good a Maſter, ſhe wipes them clean with the principal Ornament of her
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170448:28"/>head, <hi>the flaxen Towel</hi> of her hair. Thoſe diſhevelled locks, whoſe curious dreſſings were before laid out as entiſing <hi>Nets,</hi> to catch the looſe Beholders, are now religiouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to dry his feet, from whoſe paths they had ſo often digreſſed.</p>
            <p>Her Diligence waited on him, no leſs when he was interred, then when he was alive. For though <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had already beſtowed an hundred pounds of Myrrhe and Aloes for his embalming, yet ſhe prepared her Spices, and provided her Oyntments too. Not that ſhe undervalued what they had done, but becauſe Love perſwaded ſhe was to do all her ſelf. Upon gueſs that his dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Coarſe was ſurpriſed by others, how did her reſolute fervour exceed her Sex? She wooes and ſtrives to win the ſuppoſed <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner,</hi> with Titles of Honour, <hi>SIR, LORD, if you have taken him hence, tell me where he is; Ego illum tollam, I will bear him away.</hi> Timorous <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, came ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly to Pilate for fear of the Jews, and begged his body:</hi> But ſhe endued with <hi>Judiths</hi> ſpirit, cannot be daunted with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, nor appaled with impoſſibilities. She thought her Love the compleareſt harneſs, the ſureſt ſhield, and therefore ſhe begs not help, but maugre all their Oppoſition, <hi>Ego tollam, I will bear him away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this ſecond Property, we may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that the value of Chriſtian Love, is to be tryed by the ſame Touchſtone as holy
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170448:29"/>
               <hi>Mary</hi>'s was, not by words, but by obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
<note place="margin">Joh. 14.23.</note> 
               <hi>If any love me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>he will keep my Commandments.</hi> The Jews called him <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>bowed their knees before him;</hi> but they defiled his Face with Spittle, and threſhed his cheeks with blows. And what are they but degenerate, not freeborn Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who call Chriſt Lord, and bow their knees before him, yet crucifie him, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple his blood under their feet, by adhering to their impieties? What is this, but with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> to kiſs him, and betray him? We make his Scepter a <hi>Reed,</hi> when we yield him no ſway over our Affections, when his juſt Commands are more queſtioned then obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The laſt Property of Love,
<note place="margin">Philip. 4.</note> is Bountiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; <hi>Love,</hi> ſaith the Apoſte, <hi>is bountiful:</hi> This cauſed our Convert not to come nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly, and empty-handed. She would not viſit her Lord without a <hi>Preſent,</hi> without a Pledge of her homage and better meaning. The largeneſs of her heart honoured him with the beſt ſhe had, and beſtowed a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Oyntment on the Lords <hi>Anointed.</hi> An Oyntment ſo pretious, that <hi>Judas,</hi> the Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the Purſe, repined with a <hi>quanto me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius?</hi> how much better had this bin ſold for three hundred pence, and the price thereof employed to the neceſſities of the poor? Yet her modeſty rated it not ſo high, as that ſhe durſt pour it on his ſacred Head: ſhe eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it but good enough to anoint his hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170448:29"/>feet. It is true, that <hi>in nothing,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 22.</note> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>can a man be profitable to the Almighty:</hi> and ſo the riches of the Spikenard could not add any ſweetneſs to him, who is nothing but ſweetneſs it ſelf; yet he graciouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts her little Mite, as a lively Symbole of her greater thankfulneſs, and entertaines her ſmall Box of Oyntment, as a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for that ſaving Oyl, which He, the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> infuſed into her ſoul.</p>
            <p>This laſt Property of Chriſtian Love, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the Hypocriſie of thoſe who would be religious without <hi>Charges.</hi> They are like the Fig-Tree in the Goſpel, which had fair Leaves, but not ſo much as one Figg to give to Chriſt in his hunger; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the ſhew of Godlineſs, but denying the Power; talking of a flouriſhing Church, and yet endeavouring to deprive the Church of her ancient <hi>Patrimony;</hi> devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Tithes, becauſe they will not have the Lords Miniſters meddle with that them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>Nick-name</hi> Worldlineſs: A <hi>Patron</hi> ſcarce paſſing away a thin Parſonage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Reſervation of his own Tythes. Some of theſe may be ſeen garniſhing their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Dwellings, and yet contented that Gods Houſe lye naked, and more vile then ſome of their meaneſt Offices; and all for fear of bringing in their own <hi>Chimaera</hi> of ſuppoſed Idolatry, when indeed their <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> as 'tis 3 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> and their <hi>ſtubborn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> 1 Sam. 15. are the main miſchievous
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170448:30"/>
               <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Apol. cap. 39.</note> But what ſaith the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Tertullian? Pietas eſt pro pietate ſumptus facere:</hi> True Chriſtianity thinks it cannot be at too much <hi>coſt</hi> with God. For he is more delighted with <hi>Abel,</hi> ſacrificing the beſt; then with <hi>Cain,</hi> ſerving him with the worſt: with <hi>Aaron,</hi> in a decent Veſtment; then with a <hi>Noveliſt,</hi> ſtanding before him in a ſlovenly Coat. The outward reſpects of reverence, are ſtill accounted Pledges and Arguments of our Piety and inward Devotion, that with <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> we love him much; which is the degree of her Affection in this Adverb <hi>much, for ſhe loved much.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She did not love moderately or remiſsly, that were a plain ſigne of too much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing and neglect; ſhe loved earneſtly and extreamly. Other Objects may, God cannot have exceſs of Love. Tell me what pitch of Affection doth the <hi>Natural Man</hi> reſerve for his <hi>Mammon,</hi> for his <hi>Hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias;</hi> the ſame, in a far exceeding inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, did ſhe confer upon her Saviour. How could ſhe love him too much, who, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the beams of his Grace, which he vouchſafed to caſt upon her, deſerved the beſt, yea, all, and a Thouſand times more then all? The precept is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy ſtrength;</hi> which Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> expounds of Supereminent and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflowing Love, that if any other thing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170448:30"/>offers it ſelf to be loved of us, it ſhould be carried along, and made to run together with us, to the Love of God. Springs and Brooks run back into the Mayne; and ſo the leaſt Rivulet of Affection, ought not to be drained any other way then to him, of whom, and from whom, are all things. It's an ungrateful ground, that like an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bottomed Gulf, ſwallows and returns not; whereas a clean, and well-planted Soyle, renders much fruit for the many ſhowrs did fall upon it. Gracious <hi>Mary</hi> had her heart refreſhed and watered plentifully, and ſo her thankful ſoul proved fruitful in good works, and brought forth a delightful harveſt, for <hi>ſhe loved M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I need not inſiſt upon this Point: Her ſeveral Actions before expreſſed, do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly teſtifie the eminent meaſure of her Affection. You might ſee it in her Spices which ſhe brought to Chriſt alive, and at his grave. Neither was the Period there; her thankful and obedient heart fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him even beyond death. The <hi>Legend</hi> quotes <hi>Egeſippus</hi> and <hi>Joſephus</hi> Teſtimonies, how after his Aſcention from the Mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> ſhe ſequeſtred her ſelf from all the world, and led a ſolitary life in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; where, if their account be right, ſhe ſighed away full <hi>thirty</hi> years in mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his abſence. We read, that the <hi>Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> in <hi>Ezekials</hi> Temple, was ever ſhut,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 44.2.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God went once thorough it: ſo her
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170448:31"/>heart was ſhut to all Objects whatſoever, and left open onely to retain her all-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Redeemer. The <hi>ſteel</hi> of the Mariners <hi>Card,</hi> when it is once touched with the LOAD-STONE, is reported e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after to bend, and look towards the <hi>North.</hi> And ſo ſhe, having her ſoul touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſanctifying Spirit of God, had her Cogitations onely directed to him. For the meaſure of Loving God, is to Love him, ſaith devout <hi>Bernard,</hi>
               <note place="margin">De diligen. Deo.</note> without meaſure, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> with all poſſible perfection that a Creature can attain unto: Nothing can fill the print of the Wax, but the Seal that made it; nor any thing ſatisfie the Soul, but he who firſt created it. Hence is that of Saint <hi>Auſten, Domine feciſtinos ad Te;</hi> Lord, thou haſt made us for thy ſelf, <hi>Et irrequie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſt cor noſtrum donec requieſcat in Te;</hi> and our heart is unquiet, till it reſts in thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope</hi> ſhall ceaſe, and like ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows fly away; but <hi>Love</hi> mounts to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and the greater it hath been here, the higher in degree it ſhall be there; the wider entrance, and happier entertainment it ſhall finde with the Society of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,</hi> with the <hi>Beatifical</hi> Viſion and Fruition of the undivided <hi>Trinity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now bleſſed be the Lord, that leaves us not ſo deeply engaged, but hath taught our poverty a ſhort and ready way how to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſo infinite a Creditor. It is not rich
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170448:31"/>and ſumptuous <hi>Preſents,</hi> nor any worldly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, which he conſiders, that ſo our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wants may not diſhearten our often endeavours in the diſcharge of our Duty.</p>
            <p>He expects our tribute at <hi>home,</hi> and <hi>within</hi> us; the ſervice of our thanks being to be preſented by no other <hi>Preſent</hi> then <hi>Love.</hi> So that we may as well deny our ſelves, as to be wanting in the performance of our love to him, who is the God of Love, the Father, the Son, the Holy-Ghoſt; whoſe Grace, Love and Communion, be with you always.

            <p>We are to begin with the pruning of the luxuriant fleſh. <hi>They that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis too evident:
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.6.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> hath rightly obſerved, That <hi>ſome wreſted his brother Pauls doctrine to their own damnation:</hi> for becauſe 'tis ſaid in the firſt verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Chriſt hath made us FREE,</hi> and <hi>we are not under the Law,</hi> verſe 18. the <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Libertines,</hi> and others, catechize the <hi>pure</hi> Saints of their lewd Sect, that they may break the Law vvithout ſinning; in
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170448:33"/>regard being not under the Law, they are not guilty of aberration from it, and ſo not of ſin: But the Apoſtle checks thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous enemies of ſound Doctrine, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it clear, verſ. 13. that the liberty he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, doth not intend licence; nor his walking <hi>freely</hi> in the Spirit, make way to wander <hi>looſely</hi> in the fleſh. The ſatisfaction of Chriſt, frees from the tyrannical yoke and curſe of the Law; from the rigid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of Circumciſion, and other Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of the Law, 1 and 2 verſes; but it voyds not Obligation of <hi>perſonal</hi> obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Law, as 'tis a <hi>rule</hi> of life, in the 13 and 14 verſes. The end of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is not looſeneſs in practiſe, but a happy ſervice: we gaine an eaſier Maſter, no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious diſorder; yea, rather by the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Chriſt, our burden is encreaſed, a greater task is added. For whereas the Law ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adultery,</hi> the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſays,
<note place="margin">Mat. 5.28.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt not look,</hi> nor <hi>think laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly.</hi> And indeed, all the ſacrifices, all the ſacraments, all the purgings of the Law, did but repreſent the new Covenant of Chriſt, the crucifying of ourſelves, and our cleanſing through his blood. The <hi>ſhell</hi> of Ceremony we have thrown away, but the <hi>kernel</hi> of Moral and Chriſtian Duty couched under it, we ſtill retain. We caſt off the body of ſin, which defiled the body of fleſh; and inſtead of cutting away the <hi>foreskin</hi> of that member which execures the act of luſt,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170448:33"/>we prune the heart,
<note place="margin">See Coloſſ. 2.18.</note> where rotten deſires are conceived; or, as in my Text, we <hi>crucifie the fleſh,</hi> (i. e.) vve mortifie the <hi>fleſhlineſs</hi> of the fleſh, with the Affections and Luſts. To this purpoſe, and in this ſenſe, Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect are ſaid to derive their Race and deſcent from Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They which are Chriſts,</hi> are the ſame <hi>Spirit</hi> with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. and ſo are engaged to proceed in a profeſſed hoſtility with the fleſh, vvithout <hi>Truce</hi> or Ceſſation. For the <hi>Spirit</hi> is in ſuch a direct Oppoſition to the Fleſh,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.</note> that 'tis written, <hi>If ye walk after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye:</hi> and therefore <hi>Jude</hi> concludes, that the fleſhly <hi>have not the Spirit,</hi> verſ. 19.</p>
            <p>They which are Chriſts, are dead to ſin; how then can ſuch <hi>walk in the counſel of the ungodly, or ſtand in the way of ſinners?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, They which are Chriſts, are adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and regenerated, <hi>engrafted</hi> and <hi>rooted</hi> in him. Now vvhat a perverſe Conſideration vvere it, to imagine the end of theſe improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and <hi>ſuper-endowments</hi> to be, that this ſeed, that this off-ſpring of God, ſhould ſpread forth, &amp; be pamper'd vvith the <hi>Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of the fleſh, ſince the putting on of Chriſt is an inhibition to make <hi>proviſion</hi> for the fleſh, to <hi>fulfil</hi> the luſts thereof? <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. vvhich verſe is a good <hi>comment</hi> on this my Text. It doth not abſolutely forbid to make proviſion, but ſo as to fulfil its luſts. And thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s crucifying the fleſh here, intends not the deſtruction of the body, but
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170448:34"/>the ruine of thoſe corruptions which have entrenched and encompaſſed in the ſoul. For <hi>fleſh</hi> is not taken in this place for <hi>Caro carnis,</hi> for that which is the <hi>Subſtance</hi> of the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Indeed, there were Hereticks called <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triciani,</hi> who held Man's fleſh was not made of God, but of the Devil; which cauſed ſome to diſpatch themſelves, to caſt off the fleſh. But we know the fleſh, in it ſelf, like all the works of God's hand, was good and perfect; Chriſt himſelf hath aſſumed it. But by <hi>fleſh,</hi> the Apoſtle means <hi>Caro peccati,</hi> the body of ſin, the depraved will of the fleſh, the general corruption of nature, vvhich hath ſo ſcattered its poyſon through the ſoul, that the powers, vvhich ſhould command, are turned to obey their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Notwithſtanding this manifeſt truth, there was an ancient Hereſie, which being grounded upon the literal and violent ſenſe of our Saviours Counſel, that if the eye or hand offend, would have, without <hi>a Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical knife,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.9.</note> or myſtical abſtraction,</hi> the one really to be cut off, and the other pulled out: whereas the right meaning of thoſe words, intimates nothing but the death of <hi>ſin</hi> in thoſe parts, without the ruine of the parts themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is the uſual practiſe in progreſs of War, to deſtroy the pertinacious refractory <hi>Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,</hi> but to ſpare the <hi>Country;</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> muſt not let the <hi>Canaanites</hi> live, yet they may
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170448:34"/>live themſelves in their cities. Wherefore I cannot think any man ſo imperfect, whoſe natural <hi>Logique</hi> teacheth him not to abſtract the ſin from the ſubject, and diſcreetly to diſtinguiſh between the ſoundneſs of the member, and the putrefaction. Be it our ſtudy to root out, and utterly baniſh theſe inordinate qualities of the fleſh, ſo that we maintain the ſubſtance; and in purging ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant humours, do not raſhly violate the life of nature, wherein we ſhall ſhew our ſelves like wiſe Houſeholders, that pull not out the teeth of their curſt MASTIFES, but break them; as unwilling to loſe that which is uſeful, where the inconvenience alone, may ſafely be removed. It is a Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition born with us, That <hi>no man hates his own fleſh;</hi> which Religion ſeeks not to take away, but to reform. It was God's own ordinance, that we ſhould <hi>glorifie Him in our BODIES:</hi> which injunction would be impoſſible, if by unnatural and too curſt uſage, we ſhould humble them to the grave. For ſaith <hi>David,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 6.5.</note> In death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in the pit?</hi> Let then the Body have its due reſpect, but ſtill with relation to the ſoul's health; ſince otherwiſe, exceſs of affection is not Love, but dotage; and the feaſting of the body, the famine of the ſoul. For though the Devil himſelf be all ſpiritual wickedneſs, yet he hath not a more officious Engine to catch our ſouls, then the wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170448:35"/>of the fleſh. The fleſh is his acceſs, to work the admittance of his ſuggeſtions: So that the world, and the <hi>uſurping</hi> god of this world, could do nothing, or very little, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they <hi>plowed with our own Heyfer,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned our fleſh againſt us. The nineteenth verſe of this Chapter, begins with a large Catalogue of the works of the fleſh; I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run over each particular, I will touch the principal, which I conceive to be <hi>glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs.</hi> The one was the firſt ſin which appeared before the Flood; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the firſt after the Flood. <hi>Lot,</hi> who was newly delivered from the flames of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous <hi>Sodom,</hi> through diſtemper of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary element, fell into inceſt. <hi>Noah,</hi> who had lately eſcap'd the deluge of the whole world, was drowned in a <hi>Cup,</hi> when the Vine, which his hand planted, ſupplanted the Husbandman, and expoſed him to the mockage of his wicked Sons. The Aſſyrian Monarch,
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 20.16, 20.</note> 
               <hi>Benhadad,</hi> who was guarded by a Troop of Kings, and thought to have taken all his Enemies alive, was ſuddenly defeated, and ſurprized, when VVine had given him the firſt overthrow. For that which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into the Body, enters not in vaine, but is conquered, or conquers: if it conquers, then the meat feeds on the Eater, the drink ſwallows the Drinker: To him the Props of life become the Inſtruments of death. And here I cannot but obſerve how <hi>drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> of all other Vices, moſt takes the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:170448:35"/>part; for whereas <hi>God</hi> gave this <hi>Pledge,</hi> that the <hi>ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents HEAD;</hi> this ſin, as it were in a natural revenge, ſtrikes at the <hi>head</hi> of Man. You may ſee the malice of it; it wounds the head, and trips up the heeles. And now ſince ſuch decays, ruines and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance be the wages of fleſhly exceſs, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear a voyce from the Spirit, cry, <hi>Crucifie, crucifie the fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to underſtand the Congruity of the <hi>Metaphor,</hi> let's examine the Analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie betwixt mortifying the fleſh, and cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the <hi>Croſs</hi> is a moſt cruel and accurate torment. A torment, which being ſeated in the hands and feet, parts moſt ſenſible of paine, by the multitude of nerves there u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited, makes the anguiſh alſo more eminent. Such ſhould be the death of ſin in us all, a death without mercy or remorſe; A death as zealouſly executed, as willingly deſerved: For if our tranſgreſſions would plunge us in the depth of deſtruction, all pity ſhewed to them, is cruelty to our own Souls. Save theſe Traytors from the Gibbet, and inſtead of acknowledgment, they will be the firſt Enemies that wound us. Impiety knows not how to be grateful, nor vvill it ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into a wicked heart, to repay the debt of thanks. <hi>Saul</hi> loſt both his life and honour,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 15.</note> in ſparing <hi>Agag,</hi> a man appointed to dye: And can vve expect a better reward for the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170448:36"/>
               <hi>flattery</hi> of our ſins? If they firſt nayled our Saviour to the Croſs, themſelves have taught us our duties how to entertain them; And how's that? as <hi>Eſther</hi> ſerved <hi>Haman,</hi> by <hi>hanging them on their own Gallows.</hi> It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but argue us no friends of Chriſt, vvho are in peace vvith his Enemies, vvhich ſo oft as vve fondly pamper, vve endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the bitterneſs of his paſſion, and put him to a ſecond ſhame. As there's no true friendſhip among the vvicked; ſo to live friendly vvith vvickedneſs, is not love, but <hi>conſpiracy.</hi> A ſtrange conſpiracy, vvherein man is loſt by his own treachery; and by miſ-applying his kindneſs, laid open to end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs injuries. To produce ſin then, is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; not to murder it vvhen 'tis born, is deadly. The ſimple Commiſſion, may be a vvork of infirmity; but not to chaſtiſe it ſeverely, is vvilfully to maintain it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Congruity between mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and crucifying, is this: The <hi>Croſs</hi> vvas a lingring puniſhment, vvhich de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the Malefactors of breath by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, made them feel diſtinctly the decay of life, and number the expreſs minutes of their paſſions, like ſo many Sands ſtealing away from their Hour-glaſs. Is not this the very courſe, and ordinary ſtate of mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vvherein ſin expires not vvith one breath, nor is the benefit of ſanctification heaped on us all together? Sin is not ſo vveak an Inmate, as to be thruſt out of doors
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170448:36"/>vvith eaſe; it both crept into us, and vvill depart vvith leaſure. The <hi>Moon</hi> decreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not all in one night, neither doth the ſwifteſt Ebbe poſt away in an inſtant. All <hi>Fruits</hi> have ſome days to wither in, before there can be a ſeaſon to fall. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, man's limited nature is not capable of ſuch vaſt and unruly ſtrides, as ſuddenly to mount from the bottom to the top, from corruption to grace. VVhat though <hi>God</hi> by his Omnipotency can in the ſtricteſt point of time, as eaſily caſt out ſeven Devils as one? yet it pleaſeth him in theſe actions, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to the vveak ability of his Inſtruments, and to perform vvhat they can, not vvhat he is able to do. Let's not howſoever be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comforted with the tediouſneſs of this fight. A <hi>ſlow</hi> victory, is better then an <hi>eternal</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude; and our liberty vvill appear far more grateful, by how much it vvas purchaſed at a dearer rate.</p>
            <p>The laſt Similitude betwixt our <hi>mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>crucifying,</hi> is, That as in crucify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no part eſcaped ſuffering, ſo vve muſt ſuffer no ſin to eſcape crucifying. God, who freely remits our offences, and without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception cancels the general debt, vvill not accept a lame and imperfect repentance. That all tranſgreſſions may be forgiven, all muſt be crucified. For hovv can vve ſerve God vvith a vvhole heart, vvhen one Cloſet is reſerved for a boſome-ſin, when God is put to part ſtakes with the Devil in us; one eye
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170448:37"/>being caſt up to Heaven, and the other <hi>ſlyly</hi> glancing on a viler Object?</p>
            <p>I have heightn'd this meditation to the utmoſt in the general; I ſhall now apply it more particularly to thoſe, who are Chriſts appropriated FLOCK. For the <hi>adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> Sons of God in all points, as far as they may, ought to reſemble the <hi>natural</hi> Son, and tread the ſame path which he hath ſcor'd out. As Chriſt therefore ſuffered the death of the Croſs for ſin, ſo muſt they crucifie ſin, and dye to it.</p>
            <p>Was the Croſs a lingring, painful, and torturing death? Let it not ſeem grievous to us, with ſtriving and ſtrugling, with Gall and Vinegar, with pricking and piercing, and with other tortures of tedious Combate, to ſubdue our Affections, and part by part to crucifie the body of Sin.</p>
            <p>Were his Temples torn with a Crown of Thorns? Let it not ſeem harſh to ſet our ſelves againſt the <hi>thornes of the fleſh,</hi> which goad our ſides.</p>
            <p>VVere his hands and feet ſo faſt nayled to the Tree, that they were ſtop'd and diſabl'd from uſe and motion? It muſt be the care of thoſe which are Chriſts, to reſtain their hands from Oppreſſion, their feet from blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, their tongues from falſhood, their throats from exceſs, their eyes from adultery, and all their members from the motions of unrighteouſneſs. Our Saviour endured the pangs of the Croſs, till the cloſe of death; It
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170448:37"/>is likewiſe our part, never to ceaſe from curbing rebellious affections, till they be quite dead, till the Serpent hath no ſtrength to move his <hi>Tayl.</hi> For they who finde comfort in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> reſt not in a bare believing Chriſt was crucified <hi>for</hi> them, but do truely feel that they are crucified <hi>with</hi> him, the motions of ſin working not ſo ſtrongly in their mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to bring forth fruit unto death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.5. Then we are truly Chriſts, moſt deer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly allyed to him, when we reſemble his Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, when our actions ſpeak us to be his. He will be read as well in our <hi>manners,</hi> as in our <hi>names;</hi> if we can gladly weare his <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> we muſt not be ſlack to perform his <hi>Service.</hi> True <hi>Catholique</hi> Religion, is not a Doctrine of eaſe; it teacheth that no cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective Diſcipline can be great enough to prevent the <hi>out-breakings</hi> of Natures Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. Indeed, the <hi>Penance</hi> we put the body to, is over-haſty, and it laſts not long. Our Tears, if any, dry ſtreight; our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if many, are quickly thought tedious; our Faſts, but looſely kept; our Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, too ſlight to maſter our ſturdy and obſtinate Inclinations.</p>
            <p>But there have been Worthies, who have not ſpared to uſe all the means of humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which a Creature is piouſly capable of. <hi>I keep under my body,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27. ſo our Engliſh renders it; but 'tis more powerfully ſignificant in the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. The Apoſtles word imports,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170448:38"/>
               <hi>I BEAT down my body,</hi> as it were with Blows and Clubs; to note his ſtrictneſs in keeping under the obſtinacy of natural Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Some have become like <hi>Bottles</hi> in the <hi>Smoake,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> watered their couch with their Tears, grown ſtiffe in their knees, by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and faſting. I have read of others, who ſteep'd their Bread <hi>in Lye,</hi> that they might <hi>eat Aſhes</hi> with the Prophet. Chriſtian Charity believed this <hi>Vexation</hi> of body and ſpirit, was uſed as a means to advance them in their way to God: They thus <hi>macerated</hi> and wore out themſelves with a ſtrict auſterity, that by weakening the Body, they might ſtrengthen the ſoul.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> ſeverity to their own fleſh, aſſiduouſneſs at their <hi>Orizons,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inflictions of <hi>Penance,</hi> joyned with a Submiſſive readineſs to renounce their Errors upon clearer Illumination, were true effects and Fruits of a well-guided Zeal for diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Redeemer, and not practiſed in a <hi>colour,</hi> pretence, and advantage of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe ſo <hi>qualified</hi> Caſtigations of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may be, for any thing I yet know to the contrary, acceptable in the ſight of God; in regard no exactneſs, no purity, no contending to perfection, can be too much purſued in true Religion.</p>
            <p>They who are ſingled out for Chriſts pure Service, ought to be men ſeparated from the world, though within the world; not dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on the Earth, but paſſing through it; ſo
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:170448:38"/>eſtranged from covetouſneſs, that they ſcarce uſe neceſſaries; ſo far from luſt, that they feel no fleſh; ſo free from contentions, that they are not engaged by deſires; ſo ſet on their journies end, that they ſcarce carry the eye of paſſengers, or caſt a glance to any delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſpect. To ſuch, if any ſuch there be, the world is crucified, and they to the world; ſin hath no lively <hi>operation</hi> in them, no <hi>domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> over them.</p>
            <p>And ſo I proceed from the <hi>outward</hi> to the <hi>inward</hi> man; from the crucifying of the fleſh, to the mortifying of the <hi>affections: They which are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, all unbridled paſſions are to be ſubdued to the <hi>yoke</hi> of Chriſt: for by their over-eager <hi>Excurſions,</hi> men are ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed, that they diſcern nothing clearly, do nothing orderly, but become utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for holy actions. See'ſt thou a man wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in <hi>joy?</hi> As <hi>Aeſop's</hi> Crow loſt his Morſel when he endeavoured to ſing; ſo through ſecure jollity, he ſuddenly loſeth that, which maketh him rejoyce. Is any other caſt down with immoderate <hi>grief?</hi> he not onely quells the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which ſhould work a remedy, but doubles his loſs, by throwing himſelf after it. Some are ſo tranſported with <hi>anger,</hi> as if they took part with their Adverſary to vex themſelves; ſo <hi>impetuous</hi> in their <hi>hatred,</hi> that they avoid the good for the evil, by hating the perſon for the vice.</p>
            <pb n="68" facs="tcp:170448:39"/>
            <p>Again, many had never bin hurt, if they had not <hi>feared;</hi> and others had been wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to their deſires, had not raſh boldneſs caſt them on needleſs dangers.</p>
            <p>But may not the deſires, intentions and thoughts be free? No: The Law of the Goſpel takes hold of them too, as well as of our deeds. Theſe <hi>Cockatrices</hi> are to be <hi>kil'd in the very egge,</hi> before they encreaſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in age or danger. The Deſire, the Plot, the Thought, of any iniquity, is as odious to God, as if it were actually done. For 'tis done in his eye, when 'tis but thought. <hi>Chriſt</hi> looks not ſo much at the <hi>Acceſſory,</hi> as the <hi>Principal;</hi> to the evil action, as to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous intention. To a <hi>Soveraign,</hi> the intent of Treaſon is as mortal as the Act; and ſo the malicious thought of a deliberate Slaughter, which is the <hi>Mother,</hi> is to the <hi>All-Holy,</hi> murther too, as well as that act of Slaughter, which is the <hi>Daughter.</hi> Our Saviour is ſo taken with the <hi>inward</hi> part, the affection of the heart, that he judgeth both of good and evil actions according as that is well or ill affected. Let the outward Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be what it will, yet if a man <hi>regard iniquity in his heart, he will not hear him.</hi> For <hi>gravius eſt diligere peccatum quam facere;</hi> it's a worſe token of an evil man, to love ſin, then to commit it; becauſe Commiſſion may be out of a violent temptation, and ſtraying infirmity; and ſo not ſo much the ſin of our ſelves, as of thoſe remainders of ſin, which
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170448:39"/>dwell vvithin us. But our <hi>Love</hi> is all our own; <hi>Satan</hi> can but offer a temptation, the heart it ſelf muſt love it. As then God in mercy accounts the good will for the deed, in regard where there is a willing minde, there will certainly be all anſwerable endeavours to execute that will, and to reduce it to act: ſo he eſteemes the deed nothing without the will. Publick ſhews of Religion, by coming orderly to Church; outward poſtures and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the body in the Temple, are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe pleaſing to the <hi>Searcher</hi> of hearts, then as they ſerve to expreſs the inward De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and Elevation of the ſoul. For men may haply come to <hi>Church,</hi> and there deviſe how to undermine it; ſerve God, and rob him at once. And therefore the worſhip which ſtands in the appearance of a bare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, in ſtead of honouring God, doth much derogate from his honour, as giving him the eye of an <hi>Idol,</hi> unable to ſee; or at moſt the eye of a <hi>Creature,</hi> which can reach no further then the Superficies, or <hi>Skin</hi> of an action, without diſcerning the heart.</p>
            <p>It had need then be part of our Petition as well as <hi>David's, Cleanſe us, Lord, from our ſecret faults,</hi> and waſh, as well our hearts from carnal affections, as our fleſh from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil actions.</p>
            <p>We confeſs, O God, to our own ſhame and confuſion, that our back-ſlidings be many, our iniquities do teſtifie againſt us; yet <hi>Thou,</hi> who art the <hi>hope of Iſrael, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

            <p>THE high Excellency of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">SERM. 5.</note> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth ſilence, and makes adoration our ſafeſt Eloquence; vvhich caus'd me in my paſſage on the former verſe, not to dive into the depth of his fulneſs, leſt my weakneſs might ſeem to bring up the lighter things of the Schooles, and let the weighty ſink. My vvalk vvas but neer the ſhore, my approach did but touch the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines. The matter was divided only into two parts; fulneſs <hi>of union,</hi> and fulneſs <hi>of unction:</hi> yet it might juſtly ſeem a work of no mercy, no uſe to us, were thoſe prerogatives ſealed onely for himſelf; had vve no ſhare in them, any one might ſay, as the Tribes to <hi>Rehoboam, What portion have we in David?
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 12.</note> we have no inheritance, no part in him.</hi> And therefore for the aſſurance of our faith, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſoares higher, and contemplates the riches of the <hi>Fathers</hi> mercy in the face of the <hi>Son,</hi> as it ſhines and reflects upon us. To what end hath the <hi>Father</hi> given all things into the hand of Chriſt? Why is he thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170448:41"/>with all Treaſures? Is it that he might keep and hoord it up for himſelf? No: All his goodneſs hath relation to our profit; All power is put into the hands of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> that he might diſpenſe it the better for the <hi>ſons of men. It pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell, that he might be able,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>to reconcile us unto the Father, and all things to himſelf, both things in Heaven, and things on Earth, by the blood of his Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words, you may obſerve <hi>the act,</hi> one in ſubſtance, though various in the phraſe; <hi>to ſet at peace, to reconcile:</hi> The <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom reconciliation is made, <hi>to himſelf:</hi> The <hi>Object, All things</hi> in general: The diſtinction of their particular places, <hi>Things in Heaven and on Earth:</hi> The <hi>mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,</hi> or meritorious cauſe, <hi>by him, Chriſt,</hi> the ſecond Perſon: The Means, <hi>by blood;</hi> and therein the difference; it is not every ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, nor every effuſion of blood, but by his <hi>blood ſhed on the Croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the firſt part, as it lies couch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Propoſition: <hi>It pleaſed the Father, by him,</hi> or <hi>by Chriſt his Son, to pacifie, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile to himſelf all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God is ſo well pleaſed with this Act of reconciling, that though the diſobedience of our firſt Parents made him to come as a <hi>Judge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 2. &amp; 3.</note> pronouncing condemnation, <hi>You ſhall dye the death;</hi> yet as a <hi>Father,</hi> willing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh them, he repeales the Sentence, and

The Wax receives not the impreſſion before applyed to the ſeal, no more could the weakneſs of our fleſh re-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the characters of God, did not God honour and embrace this weakneſs of our fleſh. He which raiſeth another fallen, muſt ſtoop himſelf to do the courteſie. Man was fallen, and without recovery, had not God bowed the heavens and come down; had he not poured out himſelf, that all might partake of his fulneſs.

The <hi>Prophets</hi> looked over it, the <hi>Law</hi> through it; the eye of the Prophets vvas fixed on the remedy, but applyed it not. The hand of <hi>Moſes</hi> vvas too rough for the wound; the Oyl he powred in, was but Vinegar at the beſt: the <hi>Law</hi> may ſhew us the vvay, but lend no ſtrength to vvalk in it: He alone that is the true <hi>Light,</hi> can guide us; He who is the <hi>Way</hi> it ſelf, can lead us; He that is the very <hi>Door,</hi> can give us a lawful entrance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our eternal <hi>Canaan.</hi> For though God hath given power to his Miniſters, by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the means, and by vvay of meſſage, to pronounce our Salvation, nevertheleſs the full and abſolute authority remains in his own hands; and vvho ſhall wreſt it from him? To grant a <hi>temporal,</hi> is an inſeparable Juriſdiction of Princes; to aſſure us of <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting</hi> pardon, is a priviledge due to none but to the King of kings.

            <p>In the <hi>Morning</hi> of the World, he was not ſo familiar with his people; ſafety and danger were then on equal terms; there was power to ſtand, but no ſtay to recover the foot that was once falling. Deliverance was afar off, and the promiſed <hi>Meſſias</hi> either not apprehended, or at leaſt beheld through <hi>Types</hi> and Shadows; weak Objects to raiſe them to an aſſurance of faith, or make them hope for redreſs, when the diſeaſe ſeemed to outvy the Remedy.

Happy were thoſe that then needed a Phyſitian; the ſick were in better caſe then they which were ſound: For to them, even to the weak, to them which were without, and to the loſt, was he ſent, to be
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170448:44"/>a <hi>Reconciler.</hi> Come then, and ſee how gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious the Lord is, that breaks not the crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Plant, but ſtreightens it for a better uſe, and ſo frames us in a new Mould, that whereas before we tremble at the partial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our own Conſcience, we may appear before his Tribunal with boldneſs. For by our Reconciliation, we become <hi>Saints;</hi> whereas by our Creation, we are made <hi>Men:</hi> as if the pardon of ſin were a light matter, unleſs the Sinner were improved with it.</p>
            <p>In regard this boon of Reconciliation is of ſuch an excellent nature, <hi>venerable Bede</hi> accounts more honour doth redound to God, <hi>Reſtauratione Hominum, quàm creatione An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelorum,</hi> by reſtoring of man that fell, then by Creation of the Angels: Yea, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of a Sinner,
<note place="margin">12 ae q. 11. art. 9.</note> ſaith the <hi>Schoolman,</hi> is a more glorious work then the Creation of the World; becauſe the one is tranſient, the other permanent.</p>
            <p>Labour then to be in the number of true Converts; for if we come neer to God, not being <hi>by him</hi> reconciled to him, we ſhall come as ſoft VVax to the ſcorching flame, and as ſtubble to the devouring fire. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſin, as it is a tranſgreſſion, is againſt the Majeſty of <hi>God</hi> himſelf; and ſo our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation is to be made <hi>by him, I ſay, by him,</hi> to himſelf. He is the <hi>Centre,</hi> to which all hearts move: the mind is ſtill fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, unſetled; no true tranquillity, no
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170448:44"/>peace, until we be reconciled to him. As in a <hi>Circle,</hi> the more the Lines drawn from the Circumference come neer the <hi>Centre,</hi> the more they unite; the further they go from the <hi>Centre,</hi> in which they are united, the more they run out one from the other: So when we run forth from our <hi>Father,</hi> into our own Exorbitances, then we are one diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned from the other; but when we keep to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the neerer we come to him, the more we all unite. For <hi>it pleaſed the Father, by him to reconcile all things, both of things in Heaven, and things on earth:</hi> wherein the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> with the particular places for our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement, is expreſsly mentioned.</p>
            <p>As God is moſt good, ſo his goodneſs moſt diffuſive, whoſe plenteous redemption deſcends like the morning-dew, not to be ſhut up in a narrow family, no more then thoſe fatning drops can be confined within a certain Region. Hence the Evangeliſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. calls Chriſt <hi>The Light, which enlightens</hi> not a few, but <hi>many;</hi> nor many, but <hi>all,</hi> even <hi>every one which comes into the world.</hi> And yet according to the various Diſpoſition of the VVorld, the Light doth variouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten the World. We ſee Light paſs through Glaſs and Cryſtal, and yet 'tis with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the Earth, which is leſs ſolid, leſs hard, becauſe the baſe vile Earth may not admit thoſe pure beams of Light: So neither can <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Supernatural, Divine Light, enter into the ſoul which is not
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170448:45"/>waſhed and cleared by repenting Tears, and by the fire of the Spirit cleanſed from the ſordid Scurf and Corruption of the fleſh, which as earth adheres to the Soul. Let us then draw neer to him in grace, and ſo we ſhall draw neer to him in Glory. He will be with us in his protection on <hi>earth,</hi> and in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity <hi>in heaven.</hi>

<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170448:46"/>ſaith they are <hi>reconcil'd</hi> by Chriſt, in that they are made friends with us on earth, with whom before they were at open enmity. For ſeeing they have <hi>Idem velle &amp; Idem nolle</hi> with the Almighty, their will always concurring with his will, they cannot chooſe but love thoſe, on whom their <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> ſhall caſt a gracious eye.

They will be their <hi>guard,</hi> and <hi>pitch their Tents about them,</hi> Pſal. 24. So that of their protection we be ſure; but of their number, whether one, or more, it's queſtion'd by more than one. <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 32. ſaw a whole <hi>Hoſt</hi> of Angels environing him. The like did <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s ſervant about the Prophet, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6. Yet in the 10 of <hi>Daniel,</hi> the whole Kingdom of <hi>Perſia</hi> had but one Angel-Guardian, <hi>Daniel</hi> 10. The ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> were of opinion, that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily one Angel is aſſign'd to every one as his <hi>Cuſtos,</hi> and Tutor; but in extraordinary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xigents, whole hoſts of Angels are made Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants to them, whom he hath reconcil'd to himſelf by the blood of his Sons Croſs. But ſeeing this myſtery is unreveal'd in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it ſhall content us, that He, who makes his Angels <hi>Miniſtring Spirits,</hi> hath not onely broke down the partition-wal betwixt
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170448:46"/>heaven and earth, but hath given commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe glorious Spirits, who are his own neer favourites, to wait on us, and to <hi>keep us in all our ways.</hi> And ſo I am fall'n on my laſt part, <hi>the Means</hi> whereby this reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is wrought, <hi>the blood of his croſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is in vain to diſpute what God could have done; he was able by other means to ſave the world, for he might out of his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power not have puniſht ſin; the demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of his revenging juſtice ſpringing not from the neceſſity of Gods Nature, but from his voluntary diſpoſition. Yet when once he determin'd that his Juſtice ſhould take revenge, if by breach of Covenant it be wrong'd, he could not ſet us free from puniſhment, but ſo as his injured juſtice might be ſatisfied. Hence it is that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo frequently affirms, It was meet and neceſſary that Chriſt ſhould be <hi>conſecrated through ſuffering;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 24. Heb. 2.</note> that <hi>He ſhould ſuffer, and ſo enter into his glory.</hi> All the <hi>typical</hi> ſacrifices prefigured this. The <hi>Paſſover</hi> muſt be kill'd, before <hi>Iſrael</hi> could be delivered; ſo Chriſt ought to be ſlain, before we be reconciled. The blood of the ſin-offering (what beaſt ſoever it was) was to be poured out; ſo the blood of Chriſt, the true ſin-offering, was to be ſhed; for <hi>without ſhedding of blood, no reconciliation,</hi> Heb. 9.
<note place="margin">Tract. de diligen. Deo</note> Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might Holy <hi>Bernard</hi> ſay, that our reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation coſt God more than our firſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. <hi>Semel, &amp; tantùm dicendo fecit; in

For though ſin be ſoon acted, and with delight; yet 'tis long in cleanſing, and full of pain. We may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the truth there of in our own experience; we ſee it here in our bleſſed Saviour. There were not two days, nor (as ſome conceiv'd) two hours waſted, in eating that Sugred Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which diffuſed its rancor throughout the whole outward and inward man, and brought a moſt fearful death on all our Members. Thus eaſily, thus ſpeedily deſtroyed; but we could not be reſtored to life again without uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable torment, without Chriſts <hi>Blood,</hi> and that guſhing and ſtreaming from every part of his Sacred Body. So that it may be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid, <hi>Copioſa apud Eum Redemptio,</hi> our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt is plentiful, and made compleat by the ſhedding his blood upon the <hi>croſs</hi> even to death.</p>
            <p>Hereupon, becauſe the <hi>croſs</hi> was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170448:47"/>of mans Redemption, the <hi>Altar</hi> of that great Sacrifice, and the <hi>Ladder</hi> by which Chriſt aſcended into Heaven; the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church held it in high eſtimation, uſing the formal or tranſient ſign on the fore-head, as a badge of their profeſſion; thereby teſtifying their faith, and manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Heathen</hi> that they were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of their crucified God. Upon this ground was erected in their publique places, the permanent and material Croſs, to ſerve for a <hi>Trophe</hi> and monument of the exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Him that dyed for our Salvation on the Croſs.</p>
            <p>Your very <hi>Enſigns,</hi> your flagges and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in the camp, what are they but croſſes wrought with Gold and Silk? we behold the ſign of the Croſs naturally formed in a <hi>Ship,</hi> when ſhe is born with ſwelling Sailes, and rides with her Yards out-ſtretched: when a man, ſpreading his arms, adores <hi>God</hi> with pure devotion, the ſign of the <hi>croſs</hi> is there alſo. So that on this ſign natural Reaſon doth build, and Religion caſts no neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect on it. Yet this caution is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that we attribute no Divine worſhip to the Croſs, nor repoſe any hope of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the bare ſign, but as Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſayes of <hi>Helen,</hi> We adore the King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not the wooden Croſs. It ſhould be our care to ſee that the croſs of Chriſt be not made of no effect; for if he dyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to breake down the <hi>Partition-wal,</hi> and to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170448:48"/>ſlay hatred; ſhall enmity and diſcord live when he is dead? Shall he be Nailed, and ſhall not our vile affections be Nailed down with him? If God be <hi>ſlow to Anger,</hi> and <hi>ſwift to Mercy,</hi> you ought to be <hi>perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</hi> We are members of one and the ſame Body, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Chriſt is the Head; we muſt therefore be ſo affected each to other, as we ſee the members are: They envy not one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but communicate each with other; they are ſo far from retaliating, that if one foot ſtrike the other, it will not ſtrike again, but bear the infirmity with no leſs affection then before. Let us remember Him, who hath thus remembred us, as not to ſpare his own <hi>Blood</hi> to reconcile us. And ſeeing He alone is the way for us to walke, the truth to direct us, the life to refreſh us; we muſt fly to him by Him, building our neſts in the clefts of the Rocke, in the wounds of his Body, that He may be an <hi>Antidote</hi> to us, who was wounded for us; that his <hi>Blood</hi> may not cry for vengeance, but for remiſſion, and for <hi>reconciliation of all things to himſelf, both of things in Heaven, and things on Earth:</hi> Which God of his infinite mercy grant, through the ſame Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <p>In which Pithy and pious <hi>Ejaculation,</hi> may it pleaſe you firſt to take notice of this <hi>Petitioner,</hi> and then of his <hi>Petition.</hi> The <hi>Petitioner</hi> is brought in masked under the

            <p>I may not be ſo forgetful of your patience, and the time, as to waſt any of it in making a buſie enquiry, and as it were a <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Cry</hi> after this perſon: Let it ſuffice, my E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt tells you in general, he was <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Malefactor:</hi> St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and the other, ſtile him more particularly <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>thief,</hi> a common Robber, one that did oft provoke heaven; and yet He ſaid to Jeſus, <hi>Lord, remember me.</hi> He was now but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from his many outrages by the high-way, and yet he dared to ſet afreſh on him, who was the <hi>High-way</hi> it ſelf. He had ſcarce wip'd his mouth, or waſh'd his hands from his late impieties; and yet here, by a new and ſtrange kind of robbery, he is not afraid to ſteale <hi>Eternity.</hi> It may well be ſaid, that <hi>Heaven is gotten by Violence,</hi> when <hi>theeves break through, and ſteal</hi> it. I am much taken up with admiration, when I reflect upon the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:170448:49"/>
               <hi>quality</hi> of this perſon: for what is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of wonder and aſtoniſhment, then that a <hi>thief</hi> ſhould have a better knowledge of Chriſt upon the Croſs, than his diſciple had when he ſate vvith him at Supper? That a <hi>thief</hi> ſhould have a more eminent degree of faith, than the Patriarch <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the faithful, than <hi>Moſes,</hi> than the Evangelical Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> than his ovvn <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> to vvhom it vvas given by the grace of Diſpenſation to knovv Chriſt, and the Myſteries of his Kingdom?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 12.1.</note> but it vvas vvhen he vvas ſo much honoured as to have God himſelf to be his ovvn Meſſenger,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.4.</note> and to parley vvith him from Heaven. <hi>Moſes believed in the Lord;</hi> but it vvas vvhen he appeared to him in the midſt of a fiery buſh vvonderfully. <hi>The Apoſtles believed in the Lord;</hi> but they vvere eye-vvitneſſes hovv his miracles <hi>poſed</hi> nature, and that all the Creatures did homage to him as to their Creator. Theſe vvere <hi>eaſie taskes</hi> of faith: But this <hi>Petitioner</hi> believed in the Lord, vvhen vvhich vvay ſoever he looked about him, his eyes could not meet vvith any thing but horror and miſery. He doth not ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſitting at the right hand of his <hi>Father;</hi> So he is crovvned vvith Majeſty: nor unto <hi>Ieſus</hi> judging the quick and the dead; So He is attended vvith <hi>Angels,</hi> and Archangels: but vvhen he ſavv his ſide, hands and feet all bleeding, his face ghaſtly;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170448:50"/>his head drooping, and his <hi>Soul heavy to the death,</hi> even then he ſaid to Jeſus, <hi>Lord,</hi> as if he had been lifted upon the Croſs to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look Chriſts debaſements, and to make a ſhew openly that his faith ſhould out-vy his ſenſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lorinus</hi> upon the firſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> cites many who believed that this <hi>Malefactor,</hi> hanging on the right hand of our Saviour, had his body overſhadow'd with Chriſts ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, ſo that the virtue of this ſhadow procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his converſion. As if the feeble glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering light, and weake beams which he ſaw, made him gueſs at the glory which is above. But this miſconceit is wide, and empty of truth, a ſhadow without ſubſtance. For if Chriſt was crucified at the <hi>ſixth hour,</hi> as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> relates, and from the ſixth hour to the ninth there was darkneſs over all the Earth, and Chriſt died at the ninth hour; how could this ſinner receive any ſhadow, when there appeared no light? 'Tis moſt true, this extraordinary confeſſion was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally caus'd by the powerful operation of Gods Spirit. <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall come upon him, and he ſhall be turned into another man.</hi> It was ſpoken of <hi>Saul,</hi> who had a <hi>flaſh</hi> of the Spirit paſſing by him.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 10.6.</note> Give me a man whom the Spirit of God throughly Sanctifies, he ſhall feele in himſelf ſtrange alterations, his ſpirit renewed, his will reformed, his whole Body and Soul transformed into the Image of Chriſt. Looke upon the Apoſtles;
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170448:50"/>
               <hi>Ideots,</hi> and become Learned; <hi>Ignorant,</hi> and ſpeake with all tongues; <hi>Fugitives,</hi> and turn Martyrs; deny him, and perſecute him, and yet gloriouſly dye for him. Wherefore it becomes not us to pronounce condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon any man; for whiles he So journes here, he is recoverable by future amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. How know we whether God will temper him anew, and ſtamp him into good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? A waſtful childe may be call'd home, and unlive his miſpent youth; the <hi>Day-ſtar may ariſe in his heart,</hi> who now <hi>walkes in darkneſs,</hi> the Devils maske. <hi>Cinis fit vitrum;</hi> out of the dusky aſhes may be made bright Glaſs; he that is a <hi>wilde Olive</hi> to day, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row may be grafted into a better ſtock:
<note place="margin">Exod. 7.</note> 
               <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> Rod, though changed into a Serpent, was turned again into a Rod bearing bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms and fruit. Our raſh falls may prove profitable, and make us more ſafe from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. God can take occaſion to magnifie his glory from our ſins, as well as from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence. I hope I ſhall not offend to ſay, If the putrifi'd Sores of ſin had not ſmelled ranke in <hi>Davids</hi> Noſtrils, the <hi>Church</hi> had wanted many of his Pſalms. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> had never loved <hi>ſo much,</hi> if her pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſins had not been <hi>ſo many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I truſt there's none will ſo loſe himſelf, as to imagine that I propound this <hi>Pattern</hi> to encourage vice. This were to make me a <hi>Factor</hi> for Satan, whoſe Chief bait is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle and beguile our Souls, by the train
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170448:51"/>and flouriſh of example. He will ſuggeſt that <hi>Abraham</hi> was an Idolater, <hi>Paul</hi> a perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor; <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> a Courtiſan; and <hi>Semel inſanivimus omnes;</hi> the <hi>juſt man falls ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times a day,</hi> and yet he will riſe again. For by this Sophiſm he backs the licentious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine, who litle ſuſpecting in ſo fair a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance a treacherous <hi>Simon</hi> that ſhould gull him, ſings a <hi>Requiem</hi> to his Soul, the Devil bearing him in hand he may at his pleaſure give the hand of parting to all thoſe inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate <hi>Superfluities of naughtineſs,</hi> wherein he now embaths himſelf, and that at the laſt. Gaſp, a <hi>Lord remember me</hi> will ſnatch at Chriſt, and make him his own. Thus being blinded with ſenſuality, while his ſoul cleaves to the midſt of his mirth, his unwelcome end ſteales unlooked for; he's ſuck'd into the gulf, and in a moment goes down into the pit. To prevent which deſtruction, Saint <hi>Bernard</hi>'s rule is to be applyed to our hearts, <hi>Infidelis eſt fiducia, quando in ſpe peccamus;</hi> it is not faith, but preſumption, when we continue ſinning with a conceit of impunity or pardon. The truth of this Converts hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble acknowledgment, and hearty confeſſion, muſt be evidenced, before we can partake of his joyes in Chriſts Kingdom. And ſo from the porch, or entrance of the Text, let's go in, and behold the beauty and glory therein contained. <hi>And He ſaid to Ieſus, Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the name of his perſon, the name brought from Heaven, the name wherein He
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170448:51"/>vvas promiſed, and ſo long expected on the earth, that the <hi>Iews</hi> might hear, and their ears might tingle: <hi>Him, whom you have ſlain, and crucified, this Ieſus is the Lord.</hi> Now as <hi>Ieſus</hi> is the name of pity, and that wins us to love him; ſo <hi>Lord</hi> is the attribute of Majeſty, and that moves us to fear him. Firſt, <hi>Ieſus,</hi> and then <hi>Lord:</hi> for if we are not confident of his mercy, how ſhall we tremble to approach his glory? 'Tis true, what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum non eſſet coelum, niſi ibi Ieſus eſſet;</hi> Heaven would be no heaven to us, had we not there a <hi>Ieſus:</hi> And 'tis as true, that <hi>Ieſus</hi> could not be a <hi>Ieſus,</hi> vvere he not <hi>Dominus,</hi> a <hi>Lord.</hi> For vvithout the God-head, the Man-hood of Chriſt were not a ſufficient foundation of faith: the Divinity doth ſupport, enable, and deliver the humanity. So that <hi>Optimus</hi> and <hi>Maximus, Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Dominus, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Truth, hath Kiſſed each other,</hi> and by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <hi>hypoſtatical union,</hi> met in one perſon,</p>
            <p>The name of <hi>Lord</hi> is a name of power; and therefore when God ſaid, <hi>Exo.</hi> 6. <hi>I will bring you into the Land which I ſwore I would give you;</hi> all the aſſurance which he made is, <hi>I am the Lord:</hi> Again, <hi>I will paſs through Aegypt the ſame night;</hi> ſtill the <hi>fiat</hi> is, <hi>I am the Lord,</hi> Exo. 12. This occaſioned <hi>Abulenſis</hi> to put a kinde of Divinity in the very name: <hi>non eſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cativum, ſed operativum;</hi> it doth not barely ſignifie, as other feeble expreſſions do; it hath as it vvere a Soveraign povver engraven in it; it vvorketh, it effecteth: For by the name of the <hi>Lord,</hi> the very falſe Prophets vvere
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170448:52"/>able to give ſight to the blind, feet to the Lame, and to expell Devils. <hi>Peter</hi> in the depth of his diſtreſs cries, <hi>Save Lord, or elſe I periſh:</hi> As if the name of the <hi>Lord</hi> had been the ſvveetneſs of his Soul, and the very health of his Bones. The general acclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the people is, <hi>Hoſanna, Bleſſed is he that comes in the name of the Lord.</hi> So that <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> vvhen 'tis put abſolutely, is of the ſame extent vvith <hi>Deus.</hi> Upon this ground, the <hi>Septuagint</hi> doth ever render the name <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah</hi> by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Lord.</hi> And thus much ſome of the Heathen ſeemed to conceive. For as <hi>Domitian</hi> vvas the firſt Emperor that aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med this high and avvful name <hi>Lord;</hi> ſo <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> obſerves, that he no ſooner ſtiled himſelf <hi>Dominus,</hi> but he called himſelf <hi>Deus</hi> too; <hi>Dominus Deus noſter Domitianus,</hi> our Lord God <hi>Domitian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his book <hi>Adverſus Hermogenem,</hi> curiouſly diſtinguiſheth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt the name of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi> The name of <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, being <hi>Nomen</hi>

               <note place="margin">Niſi ex quo eſſe cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perunt in quo poteſtas domini age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rt.</note> a name of povver vvith relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his creatures, could not be applyed to him untill he had actually produced thoſe tranſitive and forraign vvorks, vvherein his povver vvas to be exerciſed. Which aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath text for it; for if you look into
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170448:52"/>
               <hi>Geneſis,</hi> you ſhall finde that <hi>Dominus,</hi> Lord, is no vvhere ſet dovvn before all the Works of Creation vvere particularly effected. Hence it is, <hi>Dixit Deus, God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light. Vidit Deus, God ſaw the light that it was good. Fecit Deus, God made the Great light to rule the Day,</hi> &amp;c. But vvhen the Creation vvas perfected, then, and not before, <hi>Dominus Deus dixit:</hi> The Lord God ſaid: And the <hi>Lord God took the Man, whom he had made:</hi> And <hi>the Lord God commanded.</hi> But vvith ſubmiſſion to that Learned <hi>Father,</hi> I cannot vvell yield, that therefore Chriſt ought not to be ſtiled <hi>Lord</hi> from all times, becauſe the Creatures, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of vvhom this appellation <hi>Lord</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to him, vvere made in time. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe things vvhereof he is Lord, vvere not from all Eternity; yet he had the <hi>Right</hi> of Authority over them, even before the Foundation of the vvorld vvas Laid; and he is <hi>Lord</hi> from all Eternity, even of all things; from vvhom, and by vvhom, other Lords have their being. But moſt pregnant it is for our purpoſe, that this Name <hi>Lord,</hi> vvhether it vvere given before all times, or in time, is a Name of infinite power, and tranſtendent Soveraignity; and therefore by it is decyphered Chriſts <hi>Deity.</hi> He vvas no temporal Lord; vvhere vvas his Dominion? Novv vvas that Propheſie fulfilled, <hi>A worme and no man.</hi> He vvas trod upon by the <hi>reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citrating,</hi> contradicting <hi>Iews;</hi> and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170448:53"/>nothing, but <hi>Pater ignoſce: Father, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhall end the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, who 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. makes it a marke whereby all Chriſtians are deſcribed, They are ſuch as <hi>call on the Name of the Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> In the 42 of <hi>Eſay,</hi> the bleſſed <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> ſeems to be jealous of this Name; I <hi>am the Lord</hi> (ſo runs the Proclamation) <hi>this is my Name, and I will not give it to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> I confeſs that his <hi>Vicegerents,</hi> as he ſuffreth them to ſhare with him in his higheſt title, ſo have they ſome reſemblance of this Chief prerogative. For they alſo, out of the ſlime of the Earth, and from the dunghil, can raiſe an ignoble <hi>vapor,</hi> and place it in the higheſt region of power and Authority; and if their heat be ſtirred up againſt it, yea but a little, they can again diſſolve it, and throw it down head-long, making the end worſe then the beginning. But as they cannot make the baſeſt thing in the world, ſo can they not annihilate, or nul the leaſt particle they finde Created. And howſoever they ſeeme to have power of life and death over their ſubjects; yet in as much as their hearts are in Gods hand, and He ruleth them as ſeemeth beſt unto him, they can neither quicken whom God would have depreſſed, nor depreſs any, whom God would have rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up. So that we may truely ſay, and ſing, <hi>Who is like to thee, O Lord?</hi> Glorious in thy Saints, admirable in thy Majeſty, working wonders; among them all, there is none like to thee.</p>
            <pb n="97" facs="tcp:170448:53"/>
            <p>But Chriſts <hi>Deity</hi> is confeſſed not onely by this compellation <hi>Lord,</hi> but partly by the nature of his requeſt. And ſo I proceed from the circumſtance of the <hi>perſon,</hi> to the <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of his Petition, <hi>Remember me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What a ſudden familiarity is here with God!
<note place="margin">Spes bont et conſidentia plus valent quam medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cina.</note> I have read ('tis <hi>Galen's</hi> obſervation) that a good conceit, and ſtrong confidence, oft-times proves more <hi>Soveraign</hi> then the phyſick. And therefore they who write of that renowned Macedonian <hi>Alexander,</hi> do more wonder, <hi>quòd auſus eſt aggredi, quàm quòd vicit;</hi> at his great attempts, then at his happy Conqueſts: Grant his courage, and you will yield him Victorious. So my thoughts are more amazed at the boldneſs of his Petition, then at its good ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lord, remember me:</hi> What ſhall the Lord remember, if he remembreth thee? ſhall he remember how thy Soul is foul with rapine, yea bloody with murther? ſhall he remember how thou ſoldſt him to death by thy ſins? Theſe cry as high as heaven, and ſo muſt preſs thee as low as hell. Take a view of thy whole life, and thy guilty ſoul will cry out, <hi>Lord,</hi> let not the remembrance of me be revived, but rather, let me be folded up in the darkneſs of oblivion. For among other puniſhments of ſin, this is not the leaſt; it makes Gods preſence terrible to us. Indeed <hi>Adam</hi> in the ſtate of Innocence had ſuch a <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> that he walked with God without fear, but being galled with ſin, he runs up and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170448:54"/>down like a <hi>Hart</hi> with an arrow in his ſide. So <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 5. crys out, <hi>Depart from me Lord, for I am a ſinful man.</hi> The ſight of his ſins made him fear, leſt if he ſhould be ſo near Chriſt, he ſhould awake him to revenge. But this <hi>Petitioner</hi> feels himſelf moſt miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and yet he will remit nothing of the height of his thoughts; he truſts God as om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, and moſt merciful, and ſo lets him take the charge of the ſucceſs; He holds his concluſion, in ſpight of all premiſes; and looks into heaven through helliſh pains.</p>
            <p>Such is the nature of true Sons of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> they conſider not their own unworthy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſo much as Chriſts boundleſs mercies, which aſſure them he never ſo <hi>Shuts up his loving kindneſs in diſpleaſure,</hi> but at any time they who hunger and thirſt after remiſſion, may finde eaſe for their Souls. For our Lord and Saviour never deſtroies any thing he made, without a kinde of pain and reluctan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; grieving as oft as he is forced to procure grief to any. How oft would he have ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the obſtinate <hi>Iews,</hi> and covered them under his Wings! and when they <hi>would not</hi> come in, how did their diſobedience com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to ſcatter them? He is ſlow to anger, and ſwift to mercy: <hi>Fingens plaſmata, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam faciens vulnera,</hi> as <hi>Evagrius</hi> ſweetly ſpeakes; providing the remedy before he inflicts the wound. So that the petition is the ſame, which the Prophet makes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23. <hi>Remember thy tender mercies, O Lord, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170448:54"/>thy loving kindneſs; remember not the ſins of my youth, but according to thy mercy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber me for thy goodneſs ſake, O Lord.</hi> Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> rightly catechiſeth, <hi>In Dominum non cadit oblivie;</hi> ſuch a ſlippery inconſtancy as forgetfulneſs cannot be aſcribed to God. <hi>Aquinas</hi> puts it <hi>Inter actus Deo inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> among thoſe acts which are incompatible with a Deity. Yet as the juſt be had in his perpetual remembrance, ſo God is ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. to <hi>forget the wicked.</hi> But this forgetting is <hi>effectus Irae, non defectus memoriae;</hi> a note of puniſhing, not of his not remembring. The ſum then is, <hi>Memento mei</hi> is all one with <hi>Nè excludas me.</hi> Let me not be condemned, O Lord, let me not wholly be excluded from thee: I have followed thee with thy <hi>Croſs,</hi> let me follow thee with thy <hi>Palmes:</hi> I have pledged the bitter potion of thy Cup, and dranke of thy Vinegar and Gall; let thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy afford me ſome <hi>nem Wine</hi> with thee in thy Kingdom. And this is obſervable out of the very words: It is not <hi>Memento actionum mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> but <hi>Memento Mei;</hi> he ſaith not, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member my works, or regard my merits; but Remember my <hi>Perſon, remember Me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's no condignity, or <hi>congruity</hi> of merit, anſwerable to that precedent ſin, which is put back by our Judge, that it go not before us to Judgement; nor to that preſent grace he diſtils upon us, nor to any of that future glory which God hath treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up in Chriſt for us: <hi>Dignatio eſt Chriſti,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170448:55"/>non dignitas Chriſtiani;</hi> Eternal life is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the gift of that God, whom to know to be the onely true God is eternal life. Doth the wall <hi>parturire radium,</hi> bring forth the light, which it reflects? Doth the Conduit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe create that water it conveyes? No more can man, who is a tottering wall, an empty cloud, challenge God for thoſe graces, which flow from him to Man-kind. Holy <hi>Bernard</hi>'s ſaying is moſt orthodox: <hi>Sufficit ad meritum, ſcire non ſufficere meritum;</hi> Our beſt Knowledge is to acknowledge our errors; and our faireſt righteouſneſs, to confeſs we are altogether foul and unrighteous. For there is not any thing in our actions, which can make us acceptable to God; 'tis onely the acceptation of our <hi>Perſons</hi> through <hi>Ieſus</hi> Chriſt. But where would this poor Soul be remembred? Not in this preſent life; he is weary of that, his thoughts ſoare higher: It is <hi>Cum veneris in regnum tuum,</hi> when thou comeſt <hi>into thy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had this faithful <hi>Confeſſor</hi> conſulted with fleſh and blood, he would have been judged to <hi>rave,</hi> in aſcribing a kingdom to one ſo wretchedly crucified. He ſaw the skin of our Saviour <hi>Pearl'd</hi> with blood, his totter'd Body black and blew with ſtripes and wounds: And are theſe Inducements to argue Chriſt a <hi>King?</hi> If a <hi>King,</hi> where's his Throne? where's his Scepter? Is the Croſs his Throne? are the nailes his Scepter? The brain-ſick <hi>Iews,</hi> led onely with things viſible, could
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170448:55"/>not diſcern how a <hi>Man of ſorrow</hi> could ſet up a Kingdom of Glory, and therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently deny <hi>Their</hi> Propheſies of <hi>Our</hi> Chriſt. But the veile is taken away from our eyes, the ſtumbling-blocke is removed; and 'tis the hight of our Comfort, to confeſs it beſt becomes the Majeſty of our Redeemer to manifeſt his power rather by weakneſs than ſtrength, by baſeneſs than glory. It more adorns his crown and dignity, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his Foes by ſtripping himſelf of all worldly means, than by inveſting himſelf with imperial force. Had he come with more ſtrength, the leſs had been his Victory; the more pompe he had exhibited, the leſs he had declared his God-head.</p>
            <p>Yet they are not wanting, who publiſh abroad that the Apoſtles did not ſin when they thought Chriſts Kingdom ſhould be temporal; So <hi>Salmeron</hi> affirmes:

               <hi>Franciſcus</hi> and <hi>Alphonſus Mendoza</hi> are of opinion, that Chriſt had Dominion, and the prerogative of a temporal King, moſt truly and properly in each circumſtance. But I conceive they diminiſh the Lords honour, in going about thus to encreaſe it. For 'tis moſt certain, that the Kingdom of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> from whom they derive our Saviours pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, was utterly extinct and demoliſh'd in <hi>Jechoniah. Jer.</hi> 22. makes this clear: <hi>There ſhall not be a man of his ſeed, which ſhall ſit on the Throne of David, or bear rule any more in Iudah.</hi> So that the <hi>actuall</hi> exerciſe of this
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170448:56"/>temporal Dominion, is not to be aſcribed to him by the title of <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> much leſs by that of <hi>Election.</hi> For in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6. when they would have <hi>made him King,</hi> he <hi>withdrew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and fled into the mountain:</hi> The Jews were ſo far from giving their Vote and Suffrage, that they cryed, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar.</hi> Leaſt of all was he to claime it by force of <hi>Arms,</hi> or dint of Sword. His ſtile is <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cips pacis,</hi> the Prince of peace. And it was a preſage of his Birth, that <hi>they ſhould break their Swords into Mattocks, their Spears into Sythes;</hi> and himſelf deny'd his being king of this World. We acknowledge, <hi>regnavit Dominus,</hi> the Lord raigneth; <hi>at reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navit à ligno,</hi> but he raigned from the tree. The Lords Anointed, Chriſt, the Redeemer, is <hi>Ruler,</hi> but his Government is upon <hi>his Shoulders:</hi> His Scepter is <hi>a Scepter of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> his Throne on the Earth is in the hearts and conſciences of the faithful, who have union with him here, and by him ſhall have communion with the whole <hi>Trinity</hi> in <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> hereafter in the Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I could live and die in contemplation of this kingdom above, wherein we ſhall ſee that we love, and love that we ſee; and love the more that we ſee. For the <hi>meaſure</hi> of the bleſſed ſhall be <hi>Full, heaped up, ſhaken toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and running over.</hi> Running over in God, ſhaken together in man. It's true, ſome Glory in this Kingdom is given <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenter,</hi> as the <hi>Schoole</hi> ſpeakes, more to one
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:170448:56"/>then to another; yet ſhall nothing be <hi>Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lariter,</hi> more in any one that it not in another One ſhall ſo have the gift of glory leſſer then another, that he ſhall alſo have this gift, not to covet any more Glory. For what can be more, then to have all the good that we will, and to will nothing that is not good?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſider this, you that forget God,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your Redeemer: what though all of us be in this caſe of the thieſe on the Croſs? <hi>Nos quidem juſte,</hi> we have deſerved death, even everlaſting death; yet having Chriſt, we may challenge all things, even heaven it ſelf. For <hi>having given us his ſon,

               <note place="margin">SERM. VII.</note>THe <hi>Act</hi> of the Reſurrection and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt, is the precedent and exemplary cauſe of our reviving. An <hi>Exemplary</hi> cauſe, not as if we are raiſed to the ſimilitude thereof; for Chriſt roſe, but ſaw no corruption in the grave: Our Bodies, or, if you will, our <hi>Carcaſſes,</hi> ſhall riſe again; but the corruption of the fleſh, the rottenneſs of the Bones, the duſt and aſhes, or rather nothing, whereinto we muſt be diſſolved, is incident to us all. Chriſts riſing and aſcending are <hi>exemplary,</hi> becauſe ours hath its inchoation or beginning in His; nay it hath its perfection and conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in him, before it be begun in us. For the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the ſecond chapter of this Epiſtle, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. is confident to affirm, that God <hi>hath</hi> already <hi>raiſed us up with him,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170448:58"/>and ſet us in the higheſt Heavenly places.</hi> So that even now we have a <hi>ſure,</hi> though not a <hi>full</hi> poſſeſſion of that glory, which hereafter ſhall be revealed. Againſt this principal hold of our belief, the cunning malice of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi> hath raiſed more perverſe <hi>oppoſites</hi> then againſt all the reſt of the building. And therefore leſt fleſh and blood meeting with ſo many difficulties and contrarieties, ſhould ſinke into deſpair, and tremble to fight under the Lords <hi>Banner,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> faſtens upon the <hi>mighty power</hi> of God; and to make ſure the point, betakes him to his <hi>Orizons,</hi> from the ſixteenth <hi>verſe,</hi> to this of my Text, to induce thereby a perſwaſion, that the <hi>Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> works in thoſe which believe, with the ſame force and efficacy as he did work in <hi>Chriſt:</hi> So that if we be not raiſed from the dead, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not riſen; and if we ſhall not be there where Chriſt ſits at the right hand of his <hi>Father,</hi> 'tis not true that He ſits, as it is expreſſed. For he roſe not for himſelf, but for us; He aſcended up on high, and led Captivity Captive, not for himſelf, but that he might be our <hi>High</hi> Prieſt, and make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us in the Heavenly places. This is the ſum and ſcope of the whole <hi>verſe:</hi> but that I may ſpeake no leſs fitly then truely, I reſtrain my Meditations to the later part, as to the <hi>Cardo</hi> or the <hi>Baſis</hi> both of the time and Text. Wherein you have the <hi>Efficient</hi> cauſe, <hi>The mighty power of God:</hi> the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or <hi>operation</hi> of this Power, in that it

               <hi>worketh:</hi> the ſubject, or <hi>perſon</hi> in whom it wrought, <hi>Chriſt.</hi> The <hi>manner</hi> of this work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that's twofold, deſcribed by a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Act, and both miraculous; <hi>When he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand.</hi> In the firſt act, conſider the eſtate from whence he was raiſed; <hi>From the dead:</hi> In the ſecond act, his Superemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent exaltation; and <hi>ſet him at his own right Hand:</hi> and laſtly, the place of this exaltati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>in the Heavenly places. According to the mighty working of his power,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The verity of Gods promiſe, and his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in performance, are the principal <hi>Pillars</hi> which ſupport and ſuſtain a Chriſtians confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: So that not without juſt cauſe, after we have made confeſſion in our <hi>Creede,</hi> that we believe in <hi>God,</hi> we adde in the next place, that he is <hi>Almighty;</hi> for if this ground be once ſhaken, neither Earth, nor Heaven, nor Men, nor Angels, can yeild us any hope, or life, or conſolation. <hi>Our Preaching is in vain, your faith vain, you are yet in your ſins, they which are aſleepe in Chriſt are periſhed.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſhew his affiance in Gods mighty power, <hi>conſider'd not his own body how it was dead, he regarded not the deadneſs of the womb of</hi> Sara: Nay, when the heavy mandate to ſacrifice his onely Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> did ſeeme to contradict the promiſe, that in <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaacs life</hi> all the <hi>Nations</hi> ſhould be bleſſed; yet the <hi>Patriarch,</hi> under hope, did believe above hope, <hi>quia Fidelis eſt qui promiſit,</hi> becauſe
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:170448:59"/>Faithful is he that promiſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. and not onely ſo, <hi>ſed quia potens eſt qui promiſit,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He that promiſed is able to do it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4.</note> and why? <hi>becauſe thou, even thou, who art Omnipotent, art with me.</hi> Hence is it that the glorious Martyrs of the Church regarded not the cruelty of <hi>Tyrants,</hi> the launcing of the Sword, the torture of the Rack, the ſcorching of the Fire, nor the loſs of Life. They reſt on the mighty <hi>Power</hi> of God, not fearing what man can do. Why did not the fire conſume thoſe three thruſt into the fiery Oven? was it not hot enough, or did it not burn, when the very Flames did licke up the Tormentors which put them in? Why did the Sea ſo <hi>ſpy</hi> the Lord? why ran it back, as afraid, and became a wall to <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and yet ran together again to drown <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and his whole Hoſt? Why did not the Lions in their Den rather ſnatch <hi>Daniel</hi> before he came to ground, then lie ſtill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him as <hi>Lambs,</hi> &amp; not <hi>Lions?</hi> But this, that water may not wet, though it be a great Sea; fire may not burn, though it be a flamingfire; many Lions, many hungry Lions may not touch a ſilly man, when the all-commanding power of God requires a ſtrict obedience.</p>
            <p>In Logical and natural things, <hi>Ratio facit fidem,</hi> Reaſon cauſeth us to aſſent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but in Divine and Supernatural, <hi>Fides facit Rationem,</hi> faith commands our Reaſon.
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170448:59"/>So that <hi>Credendum eſt,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>quia eſt incredibile;</hi> we muſt believe, becauſe it ſeems to us incredible, and not to be believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: <hi>Ratio enim facti eſt Potentia Facientis;</hi> for in things of wonder, the reaſon of the work is the power of the Worker. In our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of the bleſſed <hi>Trinity,</hi> the feeble brain of man apprehends it as an impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that there ſhould be a <hi>Plurality</hi> of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and yet no diſtinction of Eſſence; that there ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. that the <hi>Father</hi> ſhould be another <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> from the <hi>Son,</hi> and the Son another perſon from the Father; and yet both ſo <hi>One,</hi> that they are the very <hi>Oneneſs</hi> and Unity of nature. But Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes the <hi>Identity</hi> of ſubſtance an argument againſt <hi>Maximinus,</hi> an Arrian Biſhop, to prove God to be Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent: Otherwiſe, where is the Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of the Father, if he could not beget to himſelf ſuch a Son as is <hi>Coëſſential</hi> with him? So that the aſſurance of this mighty power, is the Fortreſs of Gods truth. It is ſtrange to ſenſe, that a <hi>Virgin</hi> chaſt ſhould bring forth a Son; but not to be doubted, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the working of Gods mighty power. For He, which could make <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod to bud, and <hi>Sara</hi>'s womb to conceive, is able alſo to make a <hi>Virgin</hi> fruitful.</p>
            <p>The Schooſes diſtingniſh the Power of God into his <hi>abſolute,</hi> and <hi>ordinary,</hi> or <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> power. The <hi>abſolute</hi> Power of God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it ſelf beyond his will, even to things
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:170448:60"/>infinite: For by it he could have made a ſtone on the ground, a Star in the <hi>Skie:</hi> a <hi>Reptil,</hi> or ſilly Worm of the Earth, a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Angel in the higheſt Heaven. But here, if ever any where, a Gnat may better ſwim, then an oxe wade; a ſimple Ignorance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preferred before an indiſcreet know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. For it were but a preſumptuous fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſearch the depth of thoſe Secrets, which are reſerved for the moſt High. The <hi>actual</hi> power of God is limited, being of the Latitude and extent with his will. By it he can do nothing but that which out of his moſt free purpoſe he determined, and did foreſee He would do.</p>
            <p>I do not love to enter into theſe high and ſecret Myſteries: onely for the comfort of our Souls, and confirmation of our faith, give me leave to obſerve <hi>In tranſitn,</hi> in the very paſſage to my Text, that the goodneſs and power of God is ſtill manifeſted and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, as it wrought <hi>in Chriſt: ACCOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DING to the working of his mighty Power, which he wrought IN CHRIST.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not the Name of <hi>God:</hi> He is the <hi>Anointer,</hi> Chriſt the <hi>Anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> Yea, the Name of God were a Name full of horror and terror unto us, were it not for the Name of Chriſt. <hi>Caelum non eſſet caelum, niſi ihi eſſet Chriſtus Jeſus.</hi> Heaven were not to us a heaven, had we not there an Anointed Saviour. For the benedictions of the Goſpel are firſt directed and made to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:170448:60"/>Chriſt; and then by conſequent, to them who are in ingrafted into Chriſt. He is the <hi>Angel of the Covenant, in whom all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are yea and Amen.</hi> Looke upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal or tranſient works, and you ſhall finde them openly proclaime and pronounce Gods Glory; but ſo, as they were done <hi>in Chriſt.</hi>

            <p>The Heathen dreamed of ſo many <hi>Guides</hi> of Nature, as they ſaw there were kindes of things natural in the world. But to us there is one onely worker of All in All, alone to be adored and honoured by all for ever. The Creator made the whole world, not <hi>with hands,</hi> but by the <hi>word:</hi> The Scripture here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is plain; <hi>All things were made BY HIM, both viſible and inviſible.</hi> And that we may know the heavenly <hi>Arch</hi> which is erected over our heads would quickly looſen and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve it ſelf into a diſordered and confuſed <hi>Chaos,</hi>

<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170448:61"/>ſupernaturally <hi>by Chriſt.</hi> When all the floodgates of Gods indignation ſeemed to be ſet open againſt us, our affliction and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity being as unſupportable as death; then it pleaſed his tender mercy to be led as a <hi>Sheep</hi> to the ſlaughter. Nay, He was the <hi>Paſchal Lamb ſlain before the beginning of the World,</hi> in his Fathers <hi>Secret</hi> decree; for his blood <hi>Prius profuit quam fuit,</hi> was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual before it was actual. I ſhould want both breath and time, if I went about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe unto you how mightily God wrought in <hi>Chriſts Doctrine.</hi> At the firſt it ſeemed abſurd, and contemptible, the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reputed the <hi>Off-ſcouring</hi> of the Earth; but at laſt, it forced their violent perſecutors to become their humble <hi>Orators,</hi> and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that of them, as an eſpecial favour, which before themſelves ſcorned to grant. Run over the <hi>Circle</hi> of Chriſts life, and winde up the whole thred of it, you ſhall behold every where the Povver of God as it vvrought <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> ſometimes in curing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and anon in caſting out vvhole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Devils. To inſtance in one for all, Remember an <hi>Army</hi> of unvictualled people ſed and Satisfied in the Wilderneſs, vvith the <hi>Poor</hi> proviſion of five Loaves and tvvo Fiſhes, <hi>Inter ſecantes dexteras crevit Ceres,</hi> as <hi>Prudentius</hi> elegantly ſings. A ſtrange, and new Creation! The bread and fiſhes encreaſe and multiply in the hands of the Eaters; the Fragments and remainders pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:170448:61"/>greater then the Feaſt. All theſe things, which the power of God wrought <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> are glorious, and full of wonder: but that the Sepulchre ſhould yeild him up, and the clouds receive him; that his dead body ſhould riſe out of the loweſt Grave, and aſcend to the higheſt Heaven, is a miracle of miracles, at which the <hi>Angels</hi> ſtood amazed. And ſo I come to the two ſpecial Acts of Gods power, as it follows in the Text, <hi>When he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſts Reſurrection aſſures us of the fruit of his Aſcenſion; it is the firſt degree of his exaltation: and therefore fix your thoughts a while upon his riſing from the dead, it being the <hi>Praecurſor,</hi> and Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to his Seſſion at Gods right hand.</p>
            <p>It was altogether requiſite that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſhould riſe from the dead; for though our redemption was purchaſed by his death; yet unleſs he had roſe again to apply it, no benefit had redounded to us; for all that, we might have periſhed. And indeed, we could never hope that any power was able to <hi>Marry</hi> again thoſe Souls and Bodies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tvvixt vvhich nature had pronounced an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Divorce, were it not that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle hath made Chriſt our Head's riſing an undoubted evidence that all his dead Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhall riſe too. <hi>As in Adam all dyed, ſo in Chriſt all ſhall be made alive,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>The dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4.10.

But whether this imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all power over the creature, this advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Throne of God, this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Divine attributes, be the right or claim of Chriſt as he is <hi>God,</hi> or as he is <hi>Man,</hi> or as he is both <hi>God and Man,</hi> the fury of controverſie, wherewith the Text Laboureth, commands me now to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, as he was the <hi>Word,</hi> had <hi>Equality</hi>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:170448:64"/>of Dominion with the Father from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but as he was the <hi>Word Incarnate,</hi> or manifeſted in the fleſh, this prerogative of fitting at the right hand of God was a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi> of his Aſcenſion. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, being <hi>Hair of all things,</hi> it was meet he ſhould be before all, who are but parts of his Inheritance; and ſeeing he was inveſted with the exuberance and excellency of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments more then any other, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite he ſhould have the firſt place before all other: From the <hi>Inſtant</hi> of his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, his Soul, as the <hi>Schoole</hi> teacheth, enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſed Viſion; but while God was cloath'd with the veile of fleſh, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the ſhadow of death, <hi>quievit Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas,</hi> ſaith <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> the Deity lay hid, and would not diſcover its whole virtue; and ſo by a voluntary <hi>minoration,</hi> and <hi>exinanition</hi> of himſelf, he ſequeſtred and laid aſide his right of Precedency and Soveraignty. But ſo ſoone as He aſcended, the <hi>God-head</hi> openly diſperſed its Beams, and ſhin'd clearly in the <hi>Man-hood,</hi> exalting it above all things created, and dignifying it with as much Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and Honour as poſſibly it could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. The Apoſtle goes further; for in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. he dares to tell us, that <hi>God</hi> is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up into glory.</hi> And indeed, to ſpeake properly, Chriſt, as he was the <hi>Word,</hi> had his Omnipotent Power in himſelf: during the time of mortality, as it were <hi>a Sword in a ſheath,</hi> he could not draw it out at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170448:64"/>of the fleſh, but then onely when it pleaſed the Father. For we read, that in ſome places <hi>He could not do many miracles.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 11.</note> At the raiſing up of <hi>Lazarns,</hi> he was glad to pray to his Father that he might exerciſe his Authority over death. Being ready to ſuffer, and ſo alſo to riſe again, his Prayer was, <hi>Father, glorifie me with that Glory which I had with thee from the beginning of the world.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 17.5.</note> He pray'd not this as <hi>bare Man;</hi> for he had not really that glory which he deſir'd, from the beginning of the world, as he was <hi>Man;</hi> but as the natural <hi>Son</hi> of God. And he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed himſelf of the ſame, not as he was Man, but as he was the <hi>Son,</hi> being in the <hi>Form</hi> of God. We may therefore ſafely reaſſume that ſaying of Saint <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16</note> God</hi> is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived up in glory.</hi> For it was at his aſcenſion that Chriſt, as he was the <hi>Son</hi> of God, had the Rule and authority over the creatures reſtored, though <hi>not beſtowed.</hi> And it was at his aſcenſion that Chriſt, as he was <hi>Man,</hi> had this <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>beſtowed,</hi> though <hi>not reſtored;</hi> The Son by a voluntary diſpenſation, emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed himſelf, and relinquiſh'd his right in the time of his humiliation. The <hi>Father</hi> by a voluntary diſpenſation, reſigned to the <hi>Son</hi> the actual execution of all power, upon this his aſcenſion.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lutherans</hi> will have Chriſts placing at the right hand God, to be an elevating of his humane nature to a true and real uſe of the Divine attributes; ſo that by virtue of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:170448:65"/>this exaltation, the humanity is become Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient, and Omnipreſent, no leſs properly then the Deity. This opinion, or rather blaſphemy, makes in Chriſt not an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> but a <hi>mixtion,</hi> and confuſion. For the Rule is ancient, and orthodox; <hi>Where two natures are conjoyned, thoſe things which are proper to one, cannot really be communicated to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Otherwiſe this <hi>Seſſion</hi> would nullifie the eſſential properties of Chriſts Body, and ſo it ſhould not be glorified, but aboliſhed. It is true, the right hand of God is every where; but 'tis a Sophiſm to hold <hi>that which</hi> ſits at the right hand to be every where. His Rule and Dominion is in every Place, but his preſence in reſpect of his Man-hood is not in every Place. For a Spiritual Subſtance hath a larger circuit, and is extended farther then a corporal. The <hi>Beams</hi> of the Sun are inſeparably united with the Body of the Sun, and yet the <hi>Body</hi> is not whereſoever the <hi>Beams</hi> are: The whole Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature of Chriſt is inſeparably united to the humane, and yet it is not conſequent that where the one is, the other muſt needs be. For although the <hi>Total</hi> Deity be in the Humanity, yet it is not there, as I may ſay <hi>Totally,</hi> becauſe it is wholly <hi>in</hi> the humanity, and wholly <hi>out</hi> of the humanity. So that the <hi>WORD</hi> is ſomewhere where the Fleſh is not, and yet the <hi>Word</hi> is everywhere <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may ſee in a <hi>Circle</hi> all the lines equally
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170448:65"/>drawn from the circumference to the <hi>Centre,</hi> but we know the <hi>centre</hi> is not whereſoever the Lines are; &amp; yet we cannot conclude that the lines of the Circle are anywhere, whereas they are not in the centre. The truth is the ſame in the point in hand, though the <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> be different. For Chriſt according to his Deity is really every where; but according to his humanity, He ſits onely at the right hand of God in the Heavenly Places; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Chriſt is, there is He both God and Man.</p>
            <p>So that the ground of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror is their ſuppoſing a falſe effect of the <hi>Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> and perſonal <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> For the <hi>Man-hood</hi> of Chriſt exalted into Heaven, is not made equal with the Father, but advanced above the Creature. When King <hi>Solomon</hi> cauſed his <hi>Mother</hi> to ſit at his right hand, did he give her an <hi>Equality</hi> in his Government? And yet we may religiouſly affirm, that the humanity of our Saviour now ſitting at the right hand of God, in a ſort, in ſome accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, raigns with equal power and Majeſty with God; that it is Omniſcient, Omnipotent, and Omnipreſent, <hi>Non in Abſtracto, ſed in concreto;</hi> not <hi>formally,</hi> as it is in it ſelf; but as it is in the <hi>Word,</hi> whereunto <hi>'tis perſonally united;</hi> becauſe through the hypoſtatical uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it can be no where ſever'd from that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which in it ſelf is infinite. And ſo Chriſt in his two natures <hi>is</hi> and <hi>works</hi> every where in a diſerſe manner, and by mixt actions: as
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170448:66"/>God by eſſential preſence; as man, by virtual co-operation with that which is eſſentially every where preſent. Hereupon we may in every place approach his Throne with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the pity and compaſſion of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood ſtill cloſing with the ſtrength and might of his God-head. The diſtinction may be learned from Chriſts own mouth in <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. <hi>All thing are given TOME;</hi> not <hi>to my humanity,</hi> but <hi>to Me.</hi> His Body then is not otherwiſe omnipotent, and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent, then as it is in the <hi>WORD,</hi> which is truely omnipotent, and omnipreſent really. The words of my Text give an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw to any contradicting Spirit: <hi>And ſet Him at his own right hand, in the Heavenly Places</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Certainly, theſe <hi>Places</hi> ſignifie nothing but a place limited for the extent of it; ſo that 'tis a ſufficent reaſon; His body is aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and ſits at the right hand of God in the Heavenly places, therefore he is not corporal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſent here below. The Manſions of Gods Houſe are many; and this is implyed in the plurality, <hi>Places:</hi> but what the joyes of theſe Heavenly places are, or how the degrees are unequal, <hi>Profecto in me totum non intrabit,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Auſt.</note> truely it will not wholly enter into us by knowledge that we may apprehend it; <hi>Sed ego in illud totus intrabo,</hi> but we ſhall whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enter into it by fruition, that we may enjoy it.</p>
            <p>Wherefore comfort ye, comfort ye, you
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170448:66"/>which long for the coming of Chriſt; <hi>Eun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem habituri eſtis Iudicem, &amp; Advocatum;</hi> He ſhall judge you, that dyed, and roſe again, and took poſſeſſion of heaven for you. What if it be ſaid, <hi>No man aſcended into heaven,
<note place="margin">Eph. 4.10.</note> but He that deſcended, the ſon of Man, which is in Heaven?</hi> ſhall we therefore deſpair? No, but we will hope ſo much the more: <hi>Licet enim ſolus intrabit,</hi> for though He alone ſhall enter into heaven, <hi>at profecto Totus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trabit,</hi> yet he ſhall enter whole, and entire.

If every mans diſeaſe were ſucceſſively written in his Fore-head, we might all in turn ſeeme unworthy of company; the <hi>Phariſee</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with all his purity and holineſs, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Thus we languiſh in Soul, not for twelve years onely, but for moſt part of our life. The Phyſitians, which are the <hi>Divines,</hi> be they never ſo good, never ſo many, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cleanſe us. Though we ſpend all our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, will and working, labour and wit, ſenſe and reaſon, and whatſoever we can bring to ſubmit to our Teachers and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, for bettering our eſtate, we do but lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger out, and cannot by ſuch means attain to perfect health, no more then this weak <hi>Woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In that the ground of this Womans diſeaſe
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170448:69"/>was her own blood, I obſerve, how ſin breeds ſo great a diſorder, that it raiſeth a commotion in our very <hi>Principles,</hi> turning the bleſſing into a curſe, the nutriment into the puniſhment. For what's more uſual, then to ſee thoſe, who give way to the fury and phrenſie of their paſſions, to ruine their Bodies by their very ſtrength? It being juſt with God to chaine a man in his own fetters to intrap him in his own ſnare. So that it behoves us not to Riot and Frolick away our natural abilities; leſt what is ordained for our ſafety, becomes an Inſtrument of our miſery.</p>
            <p>Again, did the <hi>Prodigal</hi> flux continue venting <hi>twelve</hi> years? Learn, that 'tis the Lord's method to cloud his face towards us for a while, to withdraw things moſt deſir'd, that our confidence may be approved, when we truſt <hi>He</hi> can as well helpe without the means, as by them. The impotent man at the Poole of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> was departing thence eight and thirty years: It coſt him many a deepe ſigh and ſalt tear, long looking, and as much longing, and yet no prevailing, 'till the appointed period was at hand. The Crooked Woman, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. was doubled and bowed together by the Spirit of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty eighteen years (a tedious ſpace to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the throws of fear and doubt) but after long ſearch, and much ado, Chriſt made her ſtrait. It's plain in <hi>Iohn</hi> 11. ver. 33. that our Saviours compaſſionate Soul was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170448:69"/>touched with remorſe for the Agonies of <hi>Lazarus;</hi> yet he eſtranged himſelf from him, and ſuſpended his relief. He prepares not to viſit him, till Miſery it ſelf ſpoke, and the loſs was manifeſt.
<note place="margin">Joh. 11.17</note> 
               <hi>Lazarus</hi> muſt be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terr'd, before he be recovered; caſt into a dead ſleep, before he goes to wake him up, that ſo their unexpected contentment might be greater then their former complaint. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> will have all this to be done in a Myſtery, to no other end, but that ſuch, who have <hi>deaded</hi> all their faculties to ſpiritual Actions, ſhould not deſpair, as if the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> was not to be recovered; but when Sin is waxed to the height, expect a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, and not a Confuſion. <hi>God</hi> oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times abides the extremity of evil; expects Ungodlineſs to the utmoſt; and then to magnifie his Mercy, he hath Compaſſion. Complaineſt thou with that devout <hi>Father,</hi> of thy imbred inveterate Vices, againſt which thou haſt oft reſolved, <hi>Modò,</hi> and <hi>modò,</hi> Now I will leave them, now I will ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly relinquiſh them; and yet they keep thee <hi>Priſoner</hi> ſtill, pleading <hi>Preſcription</hi> for their hold? For all this, give not thy ſelf over, where thy <hi>Phyſitian</hi> doth not; but know, that Chriſt came to cure, not onely green Cuts, ſmall Skars; but deep and inveterate Wounds, Diſeaſes of eight, twelve, of as many years old as thy life can bear date.</p>
            <p>They miſtake the good pleaſure of God, who confine it to the narrow Circumſtances
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170448:70"/>of Time and Perſons. With him all things are not onely alike poſſible, but eaſie. He is able to refine pure Gold from baſe Mettal, to ſift out fair Wheat from courſe Bran; to make the <hi>Prodigal</hi> of Nature, a <hi>Miracle</hi> of Grace; the Child of wrath, the Son of God. He can work it out of the very Flint;
<note place="margin">Mat. 3.9.</note> as well of <hi>ſtones</hi> raiſe Children to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as of <hi>Jews;</hi> and, though the Point be difficult, at the laſt gaſp, take the prey out of the Lyons Mouth.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak this, that no diſconſolate Soul ſhould go dropping, and hanging down the head with <hi>Spira</hi> the Italian, who, as it were, drew the <hi>Indentures,</hi> ſet the ſeal to his dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; made his own Hell, through a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous perſwaſion: He was one among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to whom God never intended a <hi>power</hi> to believe, nor a <hi>Chriſt</hi> to believe in. Our ſafeſt courſe is not to ſtand out by multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rebellions, but upon remorſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience inſtantly to come in.</p>
            <p>Laſtly: Is her caſe ſo neer like ours? then let us conſider it more tenderly. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, poor woman! Who is this, whom her <hi>genuine</hi> blood, her natural infirmity, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal ſickneſs, hath brought to deaths door ſtreights of unclean languiſhment? VVho is this ſo defiled with corruption, ſo tainted with ſecret ſores, that <hi>Art</hi> could not cure her, nor the <hi>Law</hi> ſuffer her to paſs for clean; yea, whom the Law prohibited from the Temple, from all ſacred things, eſteeming
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170448:70"/>all things polluted which ſhe touched? This is even the <hi>Church,</hi> ſtained with the firſt <hi>Mans</hi> Tranſgreſſion, originally corrupted, wounded, and weltring in her own Blood. if we look neerly, we ſhall find her to be more eſpecially the Church of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> For in the ſame Goſpel, under the perſon of of the <hi>Rulers</hi> Daughter, the <hi>Church</hi> of the Jews is otherwiſe ſpecified: To her cure <hi>Christ</hi> was travelling, who ſaies, <hi>I am not ſent but to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Mat. 15.24. But by the diſeaſed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſecluded from the rites of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, is meaned the people of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not deſcended from the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> not ſanctified by the <hi>Law,</hi> nor glorified in the <hi>Prophets.</hi> This part of Mandkind, ſtriving to cure the corruption of Nature by humane skill, did more encreaſe it: for ſtrictneſs of diſcipline did onely draw forth the blood of the Offenders, but could not ſtop it. The <hi>Jews</hi> enjoyed the Saviour's corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; the <hi>Nations</hi> onely heard of his Fame paſſing by, and therefore came <hi>behind him,</hi> (that is) they followed him in after-times, by the tract of the year, being glad to touch his garment, to feel him in the Sacrament by the touch of Faith. The <hi>Rulers</hi> Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and under her the <hi>Synagogue,</hi> is ſaid, verſe 18. to have dyed; dye ſhe muſt to the Law, and periſh according to Nature, that ſo ſhe may be raiſed to life through Faith in Chriſt; though moſt of the Jews, even to
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170448:71"/>this day,
<note place="margin">Mar. 3.35.</note> will not believe it, ſaying, <hi>Trouble not the Maſter, for the Damſel is dead;</hi> they will not accept of Chriſts coming, they have death in their Mouths, and refuſe the hope of the Reſurrection. But the <hi>unclean wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and under her the <hi>Corporation</hi> of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> creeps to receive the comfort of the Goſpel, hopes for health by touching Chriſts Garment, which is the Garment of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Now, Men and Brethren, ſince you know what this woman is, or rather, what your ſelves are, take it for no ſhame this once to follow a woman. So, for your Example, I proceed from the weak perſon, to her ſtrong Faith, evidenced in two Acts, <hi>Acceſſit, Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigit,</hi> ſhe came behind him, and tuched the hem of his Garment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>She</hi> did well to come; for if we would have any thing with the Lord, it's all the reaſon that may be, that we come unto him; <hi>we</hi> have need of <hi>him,</hi> not <hi>he</hi> of <hi>us.</hi> But when was it that ſhe came? that's expreſſed in the former verſe, even then, when he was in the way to the <hi>Rulers</hi> Houſe. A time, one would think, not very congruous to <hi>facilitate</hi> a ſuit. Had ſhe conſulted with her carnal Counſelors, thoſe <hi>friendly</hi> ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies would have wiſhed her (forſooth) to be more <hi>mannerly</hi> then to preſs him while he was in the <hi>heat</hi> of other imployments; for ſuch an unſeemly <hi>prepoſterouſneſs</hi> was not like to compaſs any thing. But let them
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170448:71"/>conſtrue her meaning as they will, ſhe will not intermit this opportunity. She had heard how our Saviour proclaimed openly, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 11.28.</note> and ſo feeling the burden of her own grief intolerable, ſhe thought it would be deemed pride or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, not to come, being thus invited; rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and not civility, not to do as ſhe was bid. Neither height, nor depth, nor Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities, nor Rulers, could ſeparate her from the Lord of Health. She over-looks all diſſiculties, and ſwims out of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangling Weeds, to lay hold on Chriſt, though the <hi>Monſter-headed</hi> multitude ſtood in the way, like ſo many Bears and Lyons, to intercept her paſſage.</p>
            <p>This womans forwardneſs in coming to Chriſt for her bodily health, checks our <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine</hi> negligence in flying to him for our ſouls health. Away then with theſe <hi>nice</hi> Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of worldly carriage, which abate the fervor of Zeal, and by unneceſſary delayes, withſtand, if not ruine our Converſion. In things which muſt be done, it's good to be ſpeedily roſolute; for having once neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt motions of Grace, and ſuffered them to dye iſſueleſs, we may wait long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before the opportunity of a ſecond call encourageth us. <hi>Over-ſhamefaſtneſs</hi> is an <hi>unprofitable</hi> Vertue in a Begger, whoſe importunate demeanor may well be excuſed by his neceſſity, and his earneſtneſs deſerves
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170448:72"/>rather pity then a check. All places are of alike acceſs to God: in what place ſoever we come unto him, in bed, or up; in the field, or with this woman in the <hi>road,</hi> we ſhall be ſure to have Audience. Yet, though ſhe boldly entred, her courage was quickly daſhed; for when ſhe came in preſence of <hi>him,</hi> whom ſhe was to petition, her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was touch'd vvith Modeſty; and that Diſeaſe, vvhich brought her thither for her help, made her likewiſe to fear her Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and to come <hi>behind him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Timorous Woman! What could there diſmay thee? Thy Saviour, in ſhape a man, in the loweſt Ebbe of fortune, in company vvith Sinners; and yet, vvith a dejected Countenance, commeſt thou behind him? Doſt thou tremble to behold <hi>God</hi> in the <hi>back</hi> of <hi>Man?</hi> The weakeſt ſight fears not to gaze on the Suns Glory through another body; yet ſo tender vvas the Eye of her Faith, that ſhe durſt not behold this <hi>Son</hi> of Righteouſneſs to his Face, though the Luſtre of his God-head vvas then involved in the <hi>Cloud</hi> of our humanity.</p>
            <p>In this her <hi>poſture,</hi> vve may all behold the <hi>Cowardiſe</hi> of guilt, and of a ſtained Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: For ſin is in the Soul, vvhat the Diſeaſe is in the Body; ſhame and fear inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately waites upon both. <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſooner experience of evil, but became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted vvith fear:
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.</note> 
               <hi>I heard thy voyce in the Garden, and was afraid:</hi> He runs <hi>behind.</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="tcp:170448:72"/>Who vvould not fear to ſin, which makes us thus afraid? <hi>Magnum ſupplicium peccare, etſi non puniamur;</hi> ſin it ſelf is a dreadful ſting. This penſive vvoman durſt not come into the preſence of Chriſt, for ſhame of her uncleanneſs; and the conſideration of this her impurity, made her to ſhun the eyes of the people, fearing that they alſo would repel her; being by ſentence of Law de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barred from company. In this mournful grief, ſhe placed her ſelf <hi>behind</hi> him, hoping ſecretly to ſteal her health by a touch, and ſo be gone.</p>
            <p>VVe ſtand in a miſerable and hard con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I needs muſt ſay; for while natural infirmities egges us on to ſin, inbred ſhame keeps us off from Confeſſion; what we fear not to do, we bluſh to ſpeak; and yet perhaps have a great deſire to be cured. This was the vvomans caſe; ſhe vvas troubled with a baſhful Diſeaſe, and therefore deſired to be cur'd in ſecret. The firſt happineſs is, not to fall into the ſhame of ſin; the next, is to finde a covered remedy, according to that, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 31. <hi>Bleſſed is the man, whoſe ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is forgiven, and whoſe ſin is covered.</hi> Howſoever, to fly the Phyſitian, vvhoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue muſt cure us; to conceale the Malady from him, who at firſt ſight cannot chuſe but know it, is <hi>unprofitable</hi> Modeſty. Though vve come vvith ſhame, yet come vve muſt, and creep after this afflicted vvretch, though it be <hi>behind</hi> him. VVhich <hi>poſture</hi> of hers,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170448:73"/>ſhews ſhe was quickened with a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Spirit, otherwiſe, how ſhould ſhe be perſwaded Chriſt to be ſo holy and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, as to heal by the loweſt means, that if <hi>behind</hi> him ſhe came, ſo near as his <hi>hem,</hi> ſhe ſhould receive her health from him, or at leaſt from <hi>God</hi> working in him? No ground in Nature could cauſe this perſwaſion; the Rules of Phyſick preſcribe either ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward receipt, or outward application, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vvhich, no diſeaſe is cureable; for vvhat Phyſitian can cure vvith a touch?</p>
            <p>No doubt though this vvoman could have proceeded no further then to the meer moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit (vvhich Chriſt underſtood as vvell as the touch of his Garment) that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone vvithout any corporal application, vvould have been effectual; for ſo the Faith of the <hi>Centurion,</hi> prevailed for his Servant, though abſent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.13. <hi>As thou believeſt, ſo be it done unto thee:</hi> And the Faith of the <hi>Syrophenician,</hi> Mat 15.28. <hi>Be it unto thee, even as thou wilt:</hi> And the faith of the <hi>Noble</hi> man for his Son, <hi>John</hi> 4.50. vvho vvas cured <hi>on the ſelf ſame hour.</hi> If thus the faith of one prevailed for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Maſter for the Servant, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the Daughter, the Father for the Son; much more might this vvomans faith have been ſucceſsful fot her ſelf. <hi>Approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of Spirit, is ſtronger then that of the Body. Nevertheleſs, having gotten the opportunity (vvhich is never to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected)
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170448:73"/>ſhe would ſatisfie the Spirit in the behalf of the body, with ſome bodily Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, though not powerful in it ſelf, yet ſome way <hi>ſacramental,</hi> able to convay health by the Mercy of Chriſt, though not to give it. For what was it ſhe deſired? meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the touch of his Garment: <hi>She ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her ſelf, If I may but touch his Garment, I ſhall be whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVell fare a good heart yet: though ſhe had little blood in her body, ſhe had ſpirit in her heart ſtill; after ſo much vain coſt and labour, ſhe was not ſo deſperately gone, but that ſhe could yet think of a Remedy. Think ſhe could, but durſt not ſpeak out: Thought was loud enough in the Ears of God, from whom ſhe expected cure; and therefore <hi>within her ſelf</hi> ſhe ſaid: but if ſhe ſpake out one word of her infirmity in the eares of men, ſhe feared a repulſe and puniſhment from Jewiſh Rigor, where upon ſhe ſaid no further then <hi>within her ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poor ſoul! how was ſhe diſtracted in Mind? how was ſhe driven by neceſſity, and divided in Thought? If the ſtength of Faith do beſt appear in oppoſing difficulties, behold, an unvanquiſhed Faith, not broken by a Conflict of Thoughts, not cruſhed by a VVar of afflictions, though as violent as two contrary VVinds wreſtling in the Aire, or two headlong Rivers juſtling in the Sea. Neceſſity of her danger drove her forward,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170448:74"/>ſhame of unworthineſs kept her back; health ſhe deſired, but feared the cenſure of the Law; ſhe ſaw a way to cleanſe her ſelf, but it lay through the pollution of others; ſhe was confident of the Maſters gentleneſs, but ſhe doubted the Rigor of the ſtanders by: ſhe would receive the benefit of cure; but therewithal to caſt an aſpertion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs on the Giver, would be a grief. If ſhe ſpake her caſe, ſhe proclaimed her unfitneſs; if ſhe held her peace, ſhe needs muſt ſuffer: if ſhe ſtaid to deliberare, the ſwiftneſs of Chriſts paſſion would cut off opportunity. Thus her bad cauſe fought with her faith, fear with hope, ſhame with deſire, manners with neceſſity. How could ſhe reconcile theſe contraries? how finde a covert, in publick? ſecrecy, in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude? ſpeak, and hold her peace? how get health, and ſave her modeſty? receive a benefit, and do no injury? touch, and not defile? In all this ſtorm of perplexity, ſhe fainted not, ſtill ſhe had ſomewhat to ſay, <hi>A woman for that;</hi> but yet, liek a wiſe woman, ſhe ſaid it <hi>within her ſelf.</hi> In great extremities, the force of grief turns <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelour,</hi> neceſſity becomes a <hi>Doctreſs,</hi> and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs findes a Remedy to it ſelf. This <hi>Woman,</hi> by the working of Faith, thought on a way how to ſalve all; her life, her Modeſty, the Maſters Reverence, and the Peoples purity: and that vvas <hi>by ſhooting with white Powder,</hi> by ſpeaking inaudibly, by <hi>whiſpering aloud</hi>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:170448:74"/>unto God, both below and above the Eares of men; by ſaying <hi>within her ſelf.</hi> VVhere ſhe might not approach in body, thither ſhe ſtole in heart; ſhe came to the heavenly Phyſitian, by a ſecret paſſage of Spirit, while with the open appearance of fleſh, ſhe kept aloof.</p>
            <p>Happy woman in this, who among the multitude, knew how to be alone with Chriſt, and found a paſſage, which none could ſtop!</p>
            <p>This was the womans behaviour, and this muſt be ours in like neceſſity. VVhen our fortunes are incloſed with calamity, when the body is beleaguered with ſickneſs, or the ſoul with torment of ſin; when we can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no help, either from our ſelves or Friends, from Doctors or Paſtors, vvhen ſentence is death, and judgment is pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by all our <hi>miſerable Comforters,</hi> and vve are baniſhed from the Church and all Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies; yet ſtill there's a Temple in the <hi>heart,</hi> and a ſpark of Divinity there lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which findes acceſs unto God. Say our Miſery be ſo tyrannous, that we may not ſpeak and vent our grief in words, (the common eaſe of thoſe that be helpleſs) there is yet a <hi>tongue</hi> in the heart, which may grow hot with Communication; there's the <hi>Dialect</hi> of Spirits; the Language which hath beſt audience in Heaven, is there ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Suppoſe the heart it ſelf be perplexed and troubled with doubt, we muſt yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170448:75"/>againſt threatning, hope againſt hope, caſt about againe and againe, never leave ſaying, and aſſaying <hi>within our ſelves,</hi> till a glimpſe of comfort ſhall appear like the breaking of day-light in fearful darkneſs. This weak womans Faith vvas implicated with much doubting; yet Chriſt entertains her trembling confidence with ſuch a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious geſture, as <hi>he turned about, and ſeeing her, ſaid, Daughter be of good comfort, thy faith hath made thee whole:</hi> [hath made thee whole] Here's a full <hi>tide</hi> of matter ready to ruſh in, and overflow; and I cannot, without much perplexity to my ſelf and you, make my paſſage through: I will therefore withdraw, and retire till a more uſeful ſeaſon be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred. To the immortal, eternal, inviſible, onely wiſe God, Three in Perſons, One in Eſſence, be all Honour and Glory, from Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to Generation. Amen.</p>

            <p>It could not chuſe but be a ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to this diſtreſſed woman, who, as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> hath recorded, was now fall'n down trembling at our Saviours feet, to hear her ſelf term'd by the appellation of <hi>Daughter.</hi> For, as we are the children of God, we have claim to the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Chriſt himſelf becomes our <hi>Brother,</hi> He the child of God by nature, we by Adoption. Now what bond of love is ſo ſtrict as that betwixt the Father and the Child? Mercy, and bounty are the <hi>Characters</hi> of a Father: And theſe are ſo tranſcendent in our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, that the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> chap. 49.
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170448:76"/>gives the prerogative to him. She might therefore ſecure her ſelf of his bounty; <hi>For if they that be evil can give to their Children good gifts, How much more ſhall the Father, which is in Heaven</hi> give ſo to her his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.11? And then ſhe needed not miſtruſt his mercy; For even as a Father pities his own children, ſo is the Lord mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to his, <hi>Plaſ.</hi> 103. The proofe whereof we may behold in this gracious ſpeech, <hi>Be of good comfort.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You may know the <hi>Lord</hi> by his <hi>Walke,</hi> it is in the <hi>Coole;</hi> and by his voice, it is in a ſoft woing <hi>Idiome, Gen.</hi> 3.8. and ſubſequent verſes. Thoſe ſons of thunder may be of <hi>Moſes</hi> fiery train, they are not fit Diſciples for the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> The Lord ſtands not now on mount <hi>Sinai</hi> with burning fire, and diſmal darkneſs, but on mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſpeaking to us, not by the terrible trumpet, but by the meeke <hi>Mediator</hi> of the New Teſtament, alluring with mercy, and comfort, not affrighting with terror, and Judgments: It is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar dignity of Chriſts coming to <hi>Solace,</hi> and make glad the heart. If the law make the heart as Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> covered with dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, his Goſpel calmes and lightens it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently. He did not ſhake, but ſettle the weake, unſtable Ground of this Womans faith. 'Tis not the part of a diſcreet Phiſitian to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>corraſives</hi> to a feeble <hi>Patient,</hi> whoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural temper and vigor is not able to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo forcible a preſcript: And he is no
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170448:77"/>good Phiſitian of Souls that comes in a whirlwinde, and a tempeſt againſt a dejected Sinner. They likewiſe are too ſimple, who think, becauſe they are Chriſtians, they muſt affect a grim auſtere carriage or deportment, a demure compoſed countenance like an <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi> What is a Chriſtian but his Mirth? his joy in the Holy Ghoſt, with melody in his heart to the Lord? Wherein doth the Kingdom of heaven conſiſt but in joy? <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Lord,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Paul, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain I ſay rejoyce,</hi> Philip. 4.4. <hi>Let the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous be glad, and rejoyce before God,</hi> Pſal. 68.3. For the <hi>Father of conſolation</hi> may juſtly withdraw his refreſhing comforts from ſuch as do not cheerfully rely on his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous providence. And indeed the Holy Ghoſt, who is <hi>the Comforter,</hi> ſeldome reſts on a lumpiſh Spirit. It ſeemes the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> thus conceived it: for in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 3.15. he called for <hi>muſick</hi> to cheere his Spirits before he was fit to receive the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God. Let others then number life by the hours, I ſhall meaſure it by cheerfulneſs, as I would money, not by <hi>tale,</hi> but value. My Saviour is my <hi>Pattern,</hi> who exhilarated this penſive Woman, ſaying unto her, Be of good comfort, <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Her faith is here evidently augmented by modeſty and humility, as indeed it is alwaies, the diſtance of the <hi>Patient,</hi> and the lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the deſired medicine attributes the greater power to him that ſhould cure. You
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170448:77"/>ſhall finde great difference betwixt the faith of the <hi>Ruler,</hi> and of this poor Woman, becauſe the one was led by his learning, the other by her virtue. The <hi>Ruler</hi> beſought our Saviour for his Daughter openly to his Face, the <hi>Woman</hi> came ſecretly behind his back, as not worthy to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. One prayed him <hi>to come</hi> and viſit <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.41. as if God were not alwaies, and every where preſent, but muſt change Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and make journies. The other thought it good manners to come her ſelf: the one being learned in the law, preſcribed a Legal form of cure, the <hi>Impoſition</hi> of hands, <hi>Come and lay thy hands on her,</hi> verſ. 18. as if man were neceſſarily to be cured, as he was firſt made, by Gods <hi>handy Work.</hi> Nothing would ſerve him but the hand: The other trembled in touching his Garment, yea the hem of his Garment, the loweſt inch, acknowledging his power to lie there as well as in his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Behind</hi> ſhe came, not thinking to decline the eye of Chriſt, but the eye of man; for man uſeth to abhorr all ſores, but God loves to cleanſe them. She could not hope to be cured in ſuch a manner, unleſs ſhe believed the Phyſitian could ſee in ſecret, and hear in <hi>Silence.</hi> In <hi>God</hi> there is neither behind, nor below: the body of Manhood hath parts, the Godhead is purely ſimple, the ſame on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide, and <hi>eye</hi> all over; the power where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is neither diminiſhed in Manhood, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded in the Skirt of the garment. Thus, after
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170448:78"/>a modeſter way, ſhe preſented her ſelf to the eye, which ſhe ſeem'd to decline: by the back ſhe came to the face, by the outward garment to the breſt within, by the garments hem to the top of the head.
<note place="margin">Chryſolo.</note> 
               <hi>Manu veſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum, fide Deum;</hi> the garment ſhe touched with her hand, and God with her faith. I may be bold to aver, that by a modeſt beliefe in means ſo weak and remote ſhe far out-paſſed not onely the <hi>Ruler,</hi> but the Apoſtles themſelves, who too much doted on bodily evidence. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apoſtle would not believe Chriſt was riſen,
<note place="margin">Joh. 20.25.</note> unleſs he lay his hand on his ſide, and thruſt his finger into the wound; as it were compelling his Saviour to ſuffer once more after his reſurrection. But this meeke Woman was ſatisfied with the loweſt, and moſt outward token of cure, not conſidering the garment ſo much as the <hi>Wearer,</hi> contenting her ſelf with the fartheſt <hi>Beam</hi> of an infinite Majeſty, becauſe it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not faint by degrees, nor grow weak by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, nor be defil'd by her unclean touch. For if the Sun by fingering dung with his <hi>Beams</hi> can ſuffer no pollution, much leſs the Suns <hi>Inlightner.</hi> And if our Phiſitians think it no diſgrace to handle a ſore, but an honour to cure it, ſurely the Heavenly Phiſitian is ſtrong of the ſame minde, becauſe he came from Heaven not onely to heal our bodily wounds, but to cure the ſin of the Soul: Sin it ſelf when it turns to a wound, that is, when it hangs upon us againſt our wills, and
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170448:78"/>is not embraced, then it moves not his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but his pity; the ſinner ſhall be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but he that is ſore and ſick of ſin ſhall be cured. This made the Woman ſo confident as to draw neer, and yet in the manner of her approach ſhe did not forget her modeſty; ſhe came behind ſilently, touched his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gently, and reverently, the hem of it right humbly; the leaſt ſence of Grace, the loweſt drachm of mercy, would ſuffice her. She came like a religious Theif, ſtealing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, enriching her ſelf without her Maſters detriment, not chooſing, but taking that which was next at hand, laying hold on no more then what ſhe might carry away with the Owners leave, and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>The words in the Text afford no color, not the leaſt touch that any part of Chriſt's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could work miracles. Firſt, it is not <hi>thy Touch,</hi> but <hi>thy Faith hath made thee whole. Euk,</hi> 8, 46. the <hi>Soveraign</hi> Power is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his <hi>Perſon,</hi> not to the hem of his veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and therefore Chriſt there ſaid, that virtue proceeded not out of his garment, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, out of one. <hi>Salmerons</hi> conceit is wide, that the God of Nature might give as well the virtue of healing to that coat of his, as to the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> a natural efficacy of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Iron. For if it were as natural for Chriſts <hi>Coate</hi> to heal, as for the Loadſtone to attract, then the virtue ſhould have ſhined, it ſhould have been conſpicuous no leſs at
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170448:79"/>one time then another. It would have been inherent, inſeperable from the garment: And ſo the Souldiers, which parted it, the people which trode on it, ought to receive ſome benefit as well as the Woman. But no powerful influence was derived to them; the Lords own words are partly interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>Who is it that touched me?</hi> Luk. 8. v. 45. And partly poſitive, <hi>Some one hath touched me,</hi> v. 46. which made the Diſciples, as if they had been poſed, to reply to him: <hi>Thou ſeeſt? the whole multitude throng thee, and yet askeſt thou who touched thee? Gregory</hi> the Great tells us, it is no <hi>Paradox</hi> in Divinity to ſay they thronged him, and yet they did not touch him. For many preſſed him with their bodily preſence, who never touched him with their hearts, becauſe in their devotion they were meerly abſent from him: The hand of the Soul, and not of the body, apprehends and toucheth Chriſt for our good. It was not the fingring of his garment, but her faith which went along with her finger that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched him to make her whole.</p>
            <p>But admit ſhe was healed by the touch of Chriſts garment, the Rule of the School in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, <hi>Privilegia perſonalia non trahuntur in exemplum,</hi> Perſonal priviledges, are not to be patterns of imitation. And therefore, though it pleaſed our Saviour to uſe ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſigns and rites in curing the infirm, yet we have no commiſſion that we ſhould do the like by touching of <hi>Reliques.</hi> What
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170448:79"/>if the dead man, which touched the bones of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> was reſtored to life, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13. and many were healed of their diſeaſes, at the monuments of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> the Devil, as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> tiſtifies, roaring and yelling in thoſe hallow'd places? Yet this was not done that any ſhould put confidence in their reliques, but it was the pleaſure of the Almighty by theſe teſtimonies, which then were needful, to commend to us the Doctrine, and faith of his Servants. It was not becauſe <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s bones had any power in them to revive the dead, but the Lord did raiſe from the dead him as touched thoſe dead bones, to declare the Holineſs of his <hi>Prophet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither is it a well weigh'd reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe heretofore miracles were wrought at the Saints <hi>ſhrines,</hi> therefore now we ſhould expect the ſame. <hi>Naſcenti Eccleſiae data ſunt, non conſtitutae;</hi> they were not diſpenſed to thoſe which believed, but believed not. At the firſt planting of the Goſpel; <hi>God</hi> wrought by the hands of Holy men to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the authority, and to gain credit to the Goſpel, then newly publiſhed, and not to accompany their Reliques in theſe Sun-ſhine dayes, the ſound of the Goſpel being already gone into the uttermoſt parts of the World. So that concerning <hi>miracles</hi> now much brag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of, I may ſay, as Saint <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſometimes ſaid of the miracles of the <hi>donatiſts, aut ſunt fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gmenta mendacium hominum, aut portenta fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacium Spirituum;</hi> they are either the bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170448:80"/>of Jugling <hi>Impoſtors,</hi> or the vain deluſions of infernal Spirits. For this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular of my Text we have it written, it was not the manual touching of his garment, but the ſpiritual touch by faith which made her whole; <hi>Thy faith hath made thee whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Had our Saviour ſaid, my <hi>Power</hi> hath made thee whole, he had magnified his own virtue, but not commended to her the means to make uſe of it. And therefore to ſhew how he eſteemes of faith above all other graces, he empties himſelf to fill it with honour, ſaying, <hi>Thy Faith hath made thee whole.</hi> It is without all queſtion, that the Power of Chriſt wrought the cure <hi>effectivè,</hi> as the Prime Agent, yet hath faith concurred <hi>diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitivè,</hi> the <hi>Patient</hi> was uncapable of her health without the performance of this condition by the work of the Holy Ghoſt in her. For though his ſaving power be ineffably great, yet he hath made an order <hi>modo ordinario,</hi> ordinarily it ſhall extend to none but ſuch as are believers; the effect is known onely in them; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, is Saint <hi>Markes</hi> phraſe, <hi>Mark.</hi> 6. v. 6. He <hi>could not</hi> do any power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful work in his own Country, in reſpect of their unbelief, that put the <hi>Obex,</hi> and made the damme.</p>
            <p>My intent is not to afflict your Ears with a long winded diſcourſe concerning Faith: Let who will finde leaſure to weave a curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spiders VVeb, in differing a <hi>former</hi> and a <hi>later</hi> Love in God; I deſire no more
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170448:80"/>leave then to tell you in a word, that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Love</hi> in God to be one moſt ſimply, as himſelf is moſt ſimply One, Entire, and <hi>Radical</hi> in Chriſt, accounting it with <hi>Luther,</hi> on the <hi>Galathians,</hi> a <hi>horrible</hi> thing once to think on God, without Chriſt.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe fruitleſs Contentions about Faith and VVorks, if moderate men had the ſteering of them, there would not be ſo much ado. This we ſafely ſay, Then onely they are themſelves, when they are toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For VVorks without Faith, make but a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Hypocrite; and Faith without VVorks, ſtiles thee a <hi>Carnal</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeller. I confeſs, their Functions be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, yet they muſt dwell both in one Soul, as <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> did in one Houſe. It is fit, that every thing doth ſtand in it's proper Charge and Office, yet muſt every thing need, in ſome reſpect, the Society of an other. A <hi>Queen,</hi> though in her State and Royalty ſhe be alone, goes not without her <hi>Train,</hi> her Mayors of Honour. VVe may obſerve it in Nature: The Root ſucks of the Ground, the Body receives of the Root, the Branch takes of the Body, and the Fruit ſhoots out of the Branch; Theſe ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively accompany, and go together: So Faith grounds upon Chriſts Paſſion, that gives the Sap of Love, and Love bloſſomes forth in VVorks. In Faith then, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant; in Love, fervent; in VVorks, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. By Faith in Chriſt, this feeble wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170448:81"/>is cured in a minute, whom humane Art could not recover in twelve long years.</p>
            <p>This Example ſhews, it is likely our own fault, or our own neglect, that we lie ſo long languiſhing under ſuch tedious infirmities, when Faith, and <hi>obvious,</hi> or eaſie endeavour, can cure ſo quickly; For the Vertue of Chriſt, may now be touched as well in his <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as heretofore in his <hi>Garment:</hi> His <hi>Divinity</hi> is ſtill as near, and his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendixes</hi> nearer. Chriſt is not wanting to us, but we to him, and our ſelves. Do you wonder that the woman was cured by the touch of Chriſts Garment? It might be ſo eaſily, for you may read, in the fifth of the <hi>Acts, verſ.</hi> 15. that the ſick were laid in the ſtreets, to be cured by the very ſhadow of his Apoſtle <hi>Peter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>See</hi> Mat. 17.20.</note> To remove a Sin, or a diſeaſe by Faith, is nothing ſo hard, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a Mountain.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not ſtrain the <hi>Allegory,</hi> in applying it to an humble <hi>invaſion</hi> of Mercy, when we lie ſick under a like <hi>Flux</hi> of ſin, for it fuits naturally.</p>
            <p>The Garment of Chriſt, is an <hi>Emblem</hi> of his Humanity, wherewith the God-head is ſaid to be cloathed, and habited, <hi>Philip.</hi> the ſecond; He was found in <hi>Habit</hi> as a
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170448:81"/>Man: And this <hi>Habit</hi> of his Humanity, is the <hi>Conduit</hi> of his Mercy, becauſe in the Fleſh, he reconciled the VVorld to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: ſo that to touch his Garment, is to lay hold on his Mercy. So much God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſignified in the ſixteenth of <hi>Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, I ſaw thee polluted in thine own blood: I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy blood, Live: and,</hi> as it followeth, <hi>I ſpread my Skirt over thee.</hi> Then the hem of his Garment, ſignifies the precious Drops of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, vvhich ran dovvn like <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Oyntment from his wounded Head, to the Skirts of his clothing: Or, if you will, it ſignifies the Dew of Grace de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending from the top of Chriſts <hi>Divinity,</hi> to the touch of his loweſt Members on Earth. VVherefore, from the touch of this VVoman, you may gather theſe Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
            <p>A repayring to Chriſt for Mercy, though our ſinful Sores, our bloody Fluxes, and frail Diſeaſes, run upon us never ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly: For the Son of Man came not to deſtroy, but to ſave ſinners.</p>
            <p>Next, Humility in our approach, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeming our ſelves far unworthy to ſtand before him, who are ſo defiled in our ovvn corrupt ſight, and in the ſight of equal ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.</p>
            <pb n="154" facs="tcp:170448:82"/>
            <p>The <hi>Crums</hi> of his Table, the <hi>Hemme</hi> of his Garment, his <hi>Shooe-latchet,</hi> the leaſt of his Mercies, is too good for our <hi>Betters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, a ſubmiſſive Confidence in thoſe Conveyances of Mercy, which lie next be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, though they ſeem never ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and deſpicable in humane ſight; ſuch are the <hi>Elements</hi> of water and wine in the Sacraments, the <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> of preaching the Goſpel. <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.10. muſt purge his Leproſie in <hi>Jordan,</hi> though the River of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> be as good: <hi>Joaſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 13.11. muſt ſmite the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> by ſmiting the Ground, though the blow touch not the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. Our Saviour was pleaſed to cure the blind with Clay and Spittle, though both ſeem hurtful to the ſight.</p>
            <p>VVhat ſhould we look for Extraordinary Revelations from Heaven? are not theſe eaſie and ſimple <hi>Conduits</hi> of Grace, which convey ſo great benefit, ſufficient Miracles? VVe muſt not conſider the quality of the Elements and Organs, but the Vertue of him, whoſe Ordinance hath given them a <hi>Supernatural</hi> uſe, when rightly they are performed. Remember the Example of this vvoman, vvho deſired onely to touch his Garment, ſaying then, <hi>I ſhall be whole;</hi>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:170448:82"/>and as ſhe believed, ſo it came to paſs; by Faith in CHRIST, ſhe is cured in a trice.</p>
            <p>To conclude: VVhen vve feel Chriſt to be touched by us to the purpoſe, Let's come forth, and appear before men, that Glory may be given to the <hi>Author.</hi> For our Saviours intent, by enquiring after her Perſon, (whom he needs muſt know, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he vvas not ignorant of the ſecret Fact) vvas this: To publiſh the vvork, and to ſet it forth for Gods Honour, and the Spectators Inſtruction, that all might partake the benefit of the recovery, which one had gained.</p>

            <p>Wherein we may obſerve the <hi>quality</hi> of the perſon formerly offending, <hi>Peter,</hi> an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Apoſtle; the <hi>manner</hi> of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, couched in theſe two Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>went out, and wept:</hi> The going out ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued, that he loathed the lew'd Company of the ſinful; his weeping, is an evidence that he abhorred his own ſin. And here we have the <hi>order</hi> and proceſs of his Renovation; Firſt, he <hi>went out,</hi> and then wept. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <hi>ſo ſoon</hi> as he went out, he wept. In the laſt place, is ſet down the great <hi>Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> and high <hi>degree</hi> of his ſorrow, he wept <hi>bitterly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is remarkable, that the infirmities of <hi>Peter,</hi> are more upon the <hi>file,</hi> then any of all the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as if his <hi>Lapſes</hi> were left as <hi>Cautions,</hi> that none, in a puff of Pride, ſhould ſoar aloft above others, in regard of priori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. In his frailty, we all may behold, as in a <hi>Mirror,</hi> the plain image of our own im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillity. For if the <hi>Lyon</hi> be vanquiſhed, what ſhall become of the little <hi>Lamb?</hi> Green VVood will warp and ſhrink, if ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned Timber hold not out: ſlender Treſtles muſt give way, when ſtronger Pillars bend.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170448:84"/>If <hi>Peter,</hi> whoſe Faith was ſuppoſed to be ſtrong as a <hi>Rock,</hi> did notwithſtanding waver, and reel to and fro like a rowling Stone, it behoves us to look to our feet, which ſtand upon a more ſlippery ground. Indeed, it is the deluſion of the ſeducing Spirit, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the exorbitances of <hi>Gods Saints,</hi> not for our humiliation, but imitation, as if we could hide our wickedneſs under the Vail of their holineſs.</p>
            <p>Hence was it, that the gods of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> were for the moſt part found <hi>criminous,</hi> that men might thence think they ſinned by <hi>Authority:</hi> and having known by long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how much he hath thrived by this Project, he ſtill keeps it up, he's moſt buſie in ſifting <hi>Peter,</hi> in laying open to the Eye the imperfections and blemiſhes of thoſe, which are <hi>above</hi> us, that ſo the eminence of their Perſons, may make good their Vices, and draw their Examples into Rules. To which purpoſe, the ſelf ſame Text which forbids ſin, ſhall, by his miſ-applying So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry, maintain us in ſinning: Becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> fell ſo hainouſly, his Example ſhall make the ſecure Sinner to hug all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of naughtineſs, and to run on in the ſame exceſs of riot, deceiving his own Soul. But his fiery darts do ſometimes more heal then hurt; the remembrance of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Wiles,</hi> work in the penitent, a deteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his helliſh practiſe; and makes his profane delight, his godly ſorrow.</p>
            <pb n="160" facs="tcp:170448:85"/>
            <p>Thus Hell helps to Heaven, the Devil againſt his will turns Phyſitian to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:</hi> for the foyl he received, reſolved him into ſanctifyed Tears, ſo that he gained more by weeping, then he loſt by ſinning. The Church reads his <hi>Story,</hi> as a <hi>Rule</hi> of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, and not of Preſumption; as an <hi>Argument</hi> of Fear, and not of boldneſs in ſinning; as a <hi>Motive</hi> to his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and not to his denial; for to this end it follows, <hi>he went out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He did well in going out; company doth hinder us to parley with our ſins, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our Meditations. There's no ſuch time for a man to reconcile himſelf, to make his own <hi>Atonement</hi> and peace with God, as when he is alone; then he may fully bewail and bemoan, even beſhrew and <hi>ſhrive</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto the Lord. Therefore, holy men of old, when they went about to make a fearch, and as it were a queſt of inquiry throughout the ſinful corners of their Conſcience, ſtill retired themſelves, coveting to be alone, and ſequeſtred from the Croud. <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when the evening drew nigh, went out alone into the Fields, and poured forth his Orizons, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. <hi>Jonas,</hi> preparing himſelf to mourn, ſits not ſtill, but went out of the City, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, freely disburdened his breſt into the Boſome of God, <hi>Jonas</hi> 4. VVhen was it that <hi>Jacob</hi> wraſtled with an Angel, and prevailed for a bleſſing, but being ſolitary, private, and left alone? <hi>Gen.</hi> 32. when Gods
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170448:85"/>will was that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of certain Ordinances, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had appointed, he cauſed him firſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move out of his Country, and to ſeparate from the Diſtractions and diſturbance of worldly Converſation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. He took <hi>Moſes</hi> up to the top of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and ſtrictly commanded that none ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to approach the Mount, while he vouchſafed to commune with him, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. How oft did our <hi>Saviour</hi> withdraw himſelf from the multitude, and went out into the Mountains, the Deſerts, and ſuch ſolitary places, to pray unto his <hi>Father?</hi> Wherefore, when <hi>God</hi> ſtirs thy heart, and makes it in a weeping caſe, (that is) apt, and inclined to ſhed Tears, with <hi>Peter,</hi> go out into ſome convenient place, which may witneſs thy Tears, as well as it hath done thy Sin; and where thou maiſt freely vent thy ſorrow and Contrition, without fear or ſuſpition of vain-Glory, without interruption or avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from thoſe ſad and ſerious Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which make thy ſoul to bleed within. So <hi>Joſeph,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 42.24.</note> when his affection was enflamed towards his Brethren, makes haſte to get himſelf into a private room, where this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love might more freely vent it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It cannot be denied, but ſuch, who can well away with a ſolitary kinde of life, have many opportunities to ſerve the Lord, which others have not; and have not many imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the VVorld, which others have.

            <p>For though it be not ſhame to deplore our ſins in the appearance of men, ſo long as we do it not that it may appear to men; yet Saint <hi>Pauls Decorum,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.40.</note> Let all things be done DECENTLY and in order,</hi> will the better diſpoſe us to Devotion. In the great mourning of Jeruſalem, <hi>Zachary</hi> tells us,
<note place="margin">Zach. 12.22.</note> That the Family of every Tribe was ſet apart, and their Wives apart. <hi>My ſoul,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Lamentations the eighth, <hi>ſhall weep for them in ſecret places. I pour out my heart by my ſelf,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42. The man truly humbled, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170448:87"/>in the third of the <hi>Lamentations,</hi> to ſit alone, and to keep ſilence: for good Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are reſtrained and quenched in the ſtir and noiſe of much people. It is as clear as the <hi>Sun,</hi> that a ſolitary and private place, is the fitteſt to work us to Compunction: We ſee the effect of it in <hi>Peter;</hi> for ſo ſoon as Chriſts gracious look called him home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, he demurred no longer, but at once left his ſinful company, and his own ſinne too.</p>
            <p>True Repentance is <hi>early,,</hi> not dilatory: A green Wound is to be taken in hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently; for if it be ſuffered to feſter and wrankle, the Cure will not prove ſo eaſie. Hence is it, when a true Penitent is through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awaked, as <hi>Peter</hi> here, he's forthwith ſtruck with a holy horror, he preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirs himſelf, never ſuffers his eyes to ſleep, nor his Eye-lids to ſlumber, till he hath made his peace with God by ſerious humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. The ſurvey and view of his ſin, works in him a reformation of his Life, which the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>The worthy fruits of Repentance;</hi> it brings him to ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation and Zeal, that he is much troubled in his deportment. We may behold it in this humble <hi>Penitent:</hi> for ſo ſoon as he ſet foot in the Palace, he haſtes back into the Porch; and at laſt, finding no reſting place there, he <hi>went out, and wept;</hi> which is the ſigne of his Converſion.</p>
            <p>There's nothing doth purchaſe God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170448:88"/>more then the Teares of Contrition; for though they are not meritorious cauſes, yet they are pregnant ſignes of Grace, and ſanctified means to compaſs God's Mercy in on every ſide. The Lord accepted the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of <hi>Eliah,</hi> drowned in waters, when he would not look upon the Oblation of <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, though it was ſowz'd with their own blood, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. And ſo the ſacrifice of a broken and weeping heart, is more pleaſing in his ſight, then the giving up our bodies to the Sword. In the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> lay, and in a holy ſenſe brooded on the waters. In the new Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Convert,</hi> the ſame holy Spirit moves ſtill on the waters of Repentance. He makes ſuch an account of them, that he puts them up in his <hi>Bottle,</hi> writes them in his <hi>Note-book,</hi> as it ſeemes by the Pſalmiſt; ſo many Tears, for ſo many Sins, now diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and croſſed.</p>
            <p>It is not <hi>Hereſie</hi> to ſay, That ſo oft as we bemoan our ſins, ſo oft we are rebaptized; our own tears are the <hi>Element</hi> to purge the ſtaines of pollution. VVhen all Fleſh was corrupted, <hi>God</hi> ſent the water of that great Flood upon the earth, as a Remedy to cleanſe it: and if we let the Flood of relenting Tears to over-flow our hearts, it will mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie all carnal Concupiſcence, and make fruitful the barren Field of the Soul: ſo that teares are as neceſſary to Chriſtians, as the VVaters to the Earth. A Land that's never
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170448:88"/>watered, brings nothing forth but VVeeds and Thiſtles; and the Soul will be unfruitful in good works, which is not watered with theſe <hi>natural</hi> ſhowers. Our Saviour tells us,
<note place="margin">Luk. 18.17.</note> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we be as little Children, we ſhall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. You know that Children have no other VVea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon to defend themſelves withal, but Tears; and with thoſe likewiſe muſt we be armed, if we will prevaile againſt the Adverſary. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was drowned in the water of the Sea, and we have no other <hi>Ocean</hi> to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm our ſpiritual <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in, but our own ſalt Sea of Tears. <hi>David</hi> was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in weeping, he mingled his Drink with his Tears; he did ſo drench himſelf therein, that he made his Bed ſwim in Tears; he was ſo affected with grief, that he changed even the courſe of Nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in no ſociety, but compared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a <hi>Pelican</hi> in the VVilderneſs,

<note place="margin">Rom. 8.28.</note> 
               <hi>All things worke together for the beſt to thoſe that love God;</hi> the holy Father is bold to conclude, <hi>Etiam peccata, Domine;</hi> yea even our ſins, <hi>Lord,</hi> do that too. For do they not make for our good, when thereby we become more humble, more devout, more wary in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> obſerves, that <hi>Peters</hi> faith was ſtronger after his fall, then before; as a broken bone well ſet, is the faſter. Hence it is that the <hi>Angels</hi> triumph with ſuch an exceeding joy for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a notorious ſinner, becauſe ſuch a one effectually reclaimed, becomes more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170448:92"/>more fallen out with himſelf for his ſins then any other. None more fearful of relapſes, none more careful and ſincere in Gods ſervice then he. The Soul of <hi>Iona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> was not ſo knit to <hi>David,</hi> as his is to the ſon of <hi>David.</hi> The general drift and deſire of his heart, is in nothing willingly to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, but in every thing to <hi>approve</hi> himſelf before him. Upon this ground <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> makes repentant eyes the <hi>Angel</hi>'s Cellars, and penitent tears their ſweeteſt Wines, becauſe they make them glad for the benefit which thereby accrues. Therefore for the comfort of true penitents, <hi>Chriſt</hi> after his reſurrection appeared firſt to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and to <hi>Peter,</hi> who of grievous ſinners proved the ſoundeſt converts. The one never left mourning for her ſins till ſhe left the world; and the other, as 'tis ſtoryed of him, every night about the crowing of the cocke, did riſe, and pray with continual tears. The holy <hi>Apoſtles</hi> fluxed eyes ſhould be Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons unto ours; and his weeping for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying, muſt put us in minde of our denyals. For not to yeild obedience to what we know, what elſe is it then in effect to deny Chriſt? If ever you will allot a time of tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin now while it is day, leſt darkneſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take you, and there be none to help you.</p>
            <p>In theſe ſad dayes of humiliation, every eye ſhould ſhed forth teares, and all faces gather blackneſs; that as we have ſpent our firſt days in ſin, ſo may we our laſt in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170448:92"/>Is not wrath gone forth from the Lord, when the Dove, with the Olive-Branch, is flying from us?

It is the better to fit us for that heavenly Robe, that our mortality may the eaſier put on Immortality, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our raiſe us to a ſecond being, when he ſees us ſhattered into our firſt duſt.

            <p>Nor ought it to ſtagger fleſh and blood, that God ſuffers his Church to be ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, if his entire love towards her be ſo great; for affliction is the tryal of a Chriſtian: It is without <hi>Hereſie,</hi> a true <hi>Purgatory</hi> on earth, wherein good men are purified.

To theſe are committed the hardeſt and moſt dangerous exploits, &amp; ſo they cannot but count themſelves honoured by the <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Hoſts,</hi> who elects and eſteems them worthy for the nobleſt enterpriſes.</p>
            <p>This is no new art: for if we run over the liſt of Saints from the beginning of the World, we ſhall finde God adopts none but ſuch as know <hi>how</hi> to be <hi>Wretched.</hi> In the firſt of daies, rather then righteous <hi>Abel</hi> ſhall not ſuffer, a <hi>Brother</hi> will be his executioner. <hi>Abraham,</hi> the friend of God, muſt firſt be baniſhed from his own Country, before thought fit to be a Citizen of Heaven.

Is not <hi>Joſeph</hi> alſo ſold by his Brethren? <hi>Moſes</hi> no ſooner leaves the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> but the world leaves him: what armies of miſchief begirt him, when once it appeared he made religion his profeſſion? <hi>David</hi> a man after Gods own heart, fought as many Battles with afflictions as with the enemies of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> The purſuit of a cruel Maſter, the unnatural rebellion of a Son, the apoſtacy of friends, and his own foul enormities, were means quick enough
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170448:98"/>to keep him from worldly content, and to ranke him in the firſt place with thoſe, who became <hi>Worthies</hi> by affliction. If we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, we may behold that royal Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> divided with a Saw, <hi>Jeremy</hi> at once ſlain, and buried in a ſhowre of ſtones; <hi>Daniel,</hi> who fed their Souls with the word of the living God, made a prey for Lions: and to conclude, what corner of the world is not made famous by the ſeveral martyrdomes of the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> So that I may truly call tribulation the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of good men, which keeps them from the ſurfet of Spiritual pride, and vain confidence in their own ghoſtly ſtrength. <hi>In their affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they will ſeek me diligently,</hi> ſaith God himſelf, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5. For when they feel the heavy hand of God, and ſeverely ſmart under his Rod, they are brought to an acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their ſins, from which they might think themſelves free, did not ſome chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment put them in mind of their deſert. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, ſhould the ungodly live alwaies in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, it might be thought they loved Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for their own eaſe, and ſerved God more for his reward, then honour. So Satan ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt <hi>Iob,</hi> that he loved God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gained by him, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. But affliction makes it appear, that their worſhip is not grounded upon temporal reſpects, when they can adore him in the bed of ſickneſs as cheerfully as in the greateſt calm of fortune; and are ſo far from tying their duties to his outward reſpects, that in a down-caſt eſtate
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:170448:98"/>they can renounce themſelves for him, who by withdrawing his hand ſeemes quite to have forſaken them.</p>
            <p>Again, ſhould Chriſtians want afflictions, their virtue would want matter to feed upon; and like an active fire ſadly decay, if the fuel be once ſubſtracted. Should they continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoy an interrupted felicity, what would become of their fortitude, humility, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which had they not an Adverſary to grapple with, would be buried in ſluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? No Roſe ſprings without a thorn; and moral Philoſophy teacheth us, there's no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue but hath a double vice to encounter with. They ſay the <hi>Eagle</hi> expoſeth her young ones to the tryal of the Sun, the Goldſmith deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries the Metal by the Touch-ſtone, and God approves or rejects his ſervants as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by adverſity. Are not the hotteſt Spices brayed in a Mortar, that they may yeild a more fragrant ſmell? And do they not preſs the faireſt and ripeſt Grapes, to bring forth their ſweeteſt juice? Ripe and full Ears are ſmitten with the Flail, to beat the corn out of them, and the corn is grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to make Flour. Whereupon Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> profeſſeth, <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>In mundo preſſuram ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bebitis:</hi> though ye be Gods choſen, ye ſhall have preſſures and grievances in this world, that God may be glorified amidſt your cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuffrings.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Phyſitian</hi> permits to thoſe, whom he deſpairs to recover, a liberty of their deſires;
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170448:99"/>but where hope of amendment may encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage his proceedings, bitter potions are there adminiſtred, and the intemperate longings of an unruly appetite moſt ſeverely curbed: The beaſts which are ordained for Slaughter, we permit freely to range in the fruitfulleſt paſtures, little regarding the extraordinary thriving of thoſe we accuſtome to Labour. Fruitful Vines are cut, and Pruned, and dreſſed, while the luxurious branches of the barren are reſerved onely for the fire. Do not then repine to ſee the wicked flouriſh; they are men quite given over by the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian of their Souls, and left to a reprobate ſenſe; they lye in Hell like ſheep, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49. and may fitly be compared to the unhappy fig-tree in the Goſpel, not worth the care of manuring, but ſubject to the finall curſe, and utmoſt neglect of the Husbandman. What then if the God-forſaken-man ſpreads out his Plumes, and ſeems to check the Sun in glory? Vice loves to ſeeme glorious, yea more to ſeeme then to be: And indeed it had need to have ſome pleaſure here, which hath nothing but wo hereafter. The world loves the vicious, and ſo will not puniſh them; God loves them not, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſcorns to chaſten them. He will not uſe the Rod where he means to uſe the Sword, nor will he deſtroy the body where he means to deſtroy the inward man. What remains then, but that we endeavour to bring forth the fruit of tribulation, which is a patient
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170448:99"/>ſubmiſſion under the hand of God, ſince his Chaſtiſements are effects of his love, the laſt part, by way of Conſequence? <hi>The Lord chaſtens whom he loves,</hi> therefore ſubmit to his Chaſtiſements.</p>
            <p>One would think there needs no great perſwaſion to patience, where Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the effects of Love; but rather as the <hi>Species</hi> or Image which iſſues from the Countenance into the Glaſs, is reflected into the eye of the Beholder: ſo Gods love to us, ſhould beget in us a love, which is reflected upon him, the Author of all love; yea, Love it ſelf. When the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then judged the Chriſtians unhappy, becauſe they ſuffered poverty, ſpoil, exile, and the like; Saint <hi>Auſten</hi> anſwered, Now ſurely their caſe were miſerable, if they could be carried any whither <hi>ubi Creatorem ſuum non invenirent,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

               </note> where they might not find their Creators loving Protection. But ſo long as Gods favourable Preſence is with them, they cannot be unhappy: His torments are certain benefits, and a ſure way to Heaven. Hereupon Saint <hi>Paul</hi> accounts his afflictions no leſs then the <hi>very dying of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that the life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in his and our body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10.

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170448:100"/>the City, in perils in the Wilderneſs, in perils among falſe Brethren;</hi> Good God! how many men, how many <hi>holy Pauls</hi> ſeem there to be preſented to me? is it poſſible one man ſhould ſuſtain an army of afflictions? or, that one ſoul ſhould encounter ſo many Croſſes? Yes, what cannot he endure as Chriſts Beloved? what cannot he do in the power of him that doth all things? in the Vertue of Chriſts Death, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> can tire and weary out his Torments. He can prevent the fury of Death, by dying to himſelf; and by mortifying his own fleſh, like a dead Carkaſe, become inſenſible of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond pain. Hence it is, that the Primitive Martyrs looked on Tyrants, Lyons, Devils, with undaunted Countenances, walked through Gaols, Gives and Hells, without ſtartling; yeelded their Limbs to be mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, their Joynts to be racked, their fleſh to boyl'd in ſcalding Oyls, and embraced Death with Cheerfulneſs: they conſidered not <hi>quam poenam habuerunt in flagello,</hi> what ſmart they endured in the ſcourge; <hi>ſed quem locum in teſtamento,</hi> but what right and intereſt they had in their heavenly Fathers Will. And therefore, if God wounded them, they counted his VVounds the VVounds of a Friend, tending to their good. If he put them to the Sword, they embraced that as an occaſion of everlaſting victory, being fully perſwaded that Death would be to them an entrance to Life, and a paſſage to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170448:100"/>Immortality. They remembred to their Conſolation, that when <hi>Steven</hi> was ſtoned, he ſaw Heaven opened, and Chriſt at the right hand of his Father, ready to receive him. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> was beſet with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyrians, he ſaw a Hill of fiery Chariots in his Defence; and ſo, recording Gods un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable promiſes, they reckon all the perplexities of this life, and the extremities of death it ſelf, to be but as <hi>Eliſha's</hi> fiery Chariot to carry them to Heaven, or like <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſoars, to ſend them to <hi>Abrahams</hi> Boſome. Thus did holy <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelf, when the Empreſs <hi>Eudoxia</hi> breathed out threatnings and ſlaughters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him.</p>
            <p>If, ſaith the good Father,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſ. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. ad Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riamon.</note> ſhe'll baniſh me, let her uſe her pleaſure; <hi>the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof.</hi> If ſhe'll throw me into the Sea, let her; I remember <hi>Jonas.</hi> If ſhe'll caſt me into the Furnace, I have the three Children encouraging my patience. If ſhe'll expoſe me to wild Beaſts, I remember <hi>Daniel,</hi> caſt to the Lyons in the Den. If ſhe'll ſtone me, I have <hi>Steven</hi> the <hi>Proto-Martyr</hi> for my Leader. If ſhe'll take off my Head, let her take it, I have the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> for my pattern. If ſhe'll ſtrip me of my Goods, let her diſpoſe of them; <hi>Naked came I out of my Mothers Womb, and naked ſhall I return.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O, what a rare Vertue was it, thus to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer himſelf, that miſery might not conquer
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170448:101"/>him! How doth this chearful Reſolution of that precious Saint, check our cowarciſe, who cannot endute in cold blood to loſe a Limb with patience, nor abide the ſhort diſpleaſure of ſome few odd minutes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thinking preſently of Rebelling, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away ſo ſoon as call'd to the field.</p>
            <p>To prevent ſuch an indiſcretion, let us conſider there's no greater ſign of diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and grace, then to ſmart patiently and contentedly, to reſt our hearts in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and VViſdome of God. For to ſtruggle with afflictions, doth the more entangle our ſelves; and, as it falls out with the Bird in the ſnare, it works rather our Captivity then Enlargement. Our Saviour, when he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that cruel ſhameful Death on the Croſs, might have redeemed himſelf by deſcending from the Tree; but he chuſed rather to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe his patience, then to ſhew the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power: thereby leſſoning us, that Sufferings are greater tryals then Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>If then the Lord ſhall cauſe the Sun to go down upon thee at Noon, as <hi>Amos</hi> phraſeth it, ſending affliction in the midſt of thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity; if poverty come upon thee like an armed man, ſtartle not at it; if naked, be not dejected; thou art then bleſſed, being miſerable; and approved of God, though thus loathſome. When the Angel of the Lord ſaw <hi>Joſuah</hi> the high Prieſt ſtand before him in filthy Garments, he cauſed them to be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170448:101"/>taken from him, and to be cloathed with change of rayment, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3. The more deſtitute you are, the more conformable you are to the Author and Finiſher of your Faith, who, at his birth, had no better Cradle then a Cratch; in his middle age, without a houſe to put his head in; and at his death, had not ſo much ground as would ſerve for the length of his body, but <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> is fain to put him in his own Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>Is a malicious falſe gloſs caſt upon thy ſincere Intentions, and publick Actions? Conſider, the beſt cauſe doth not always find the beſt patronage. <hi>Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenes</hi> admirable Zeal, is with <hi>Judas,</hi> looſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality. Good Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that heavenly Apoſtle, who, as <hi>Maximus</hi> ſpeaks, learned among the Angels, what he ſhould preach among men; who brake many a quiet ſleep, to break the word aright to his people; for all his Graces and Labours, is hated, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed an enemy by his own <hi>Galatians;</hi> and yet, not long before, they were ready to pull out their eyes to do him ſervice.</p>
            <p>Is thy good name blaſted with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant guſts of detraction? <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the eighth, <hi>I, and the Children whom the Lord gave me, are as ſignes and wonders in Iſrael; yea, as Monſters, not worthy to live,</hi> Zachariah the third.

               <hi>He is a Samaritan, and hath a Devil.</hi> Is <hi>Jobs</hi> Croſs ſtrange and extraordinary? his own Friends judge him a tranſgreſſor. What remains then, but that in the extremity of all Outrages, which can be committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our upright dealings, we earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to obtain a firm perſwaſion of Gods ſpecial Favour to our innocent perſons; and then the ſenſe of his gracious preſence, will ſoften and ſweeten all our diſquiet.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David,</hi> in <hi>Ziklag,</hi> was at a low Ebbe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30. his Eſtate gone, his Goods ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, his Houſe burned; he was ſtript of all outward Comforts, the Enemy had got into Poſſeſſion; the loſs of their Children had ſo imbittered the People, that they talk'd of ſtoning <hi>David,</hi> verſe 6. yet, ſaith the Text, He <hi>encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God;</hi> he comforted his heart in the ſpring of comfort, ſteel'd and confirmed it with this Concluſion, That the Lord of Hoſts, the God of the Armies of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was more able to help him, and fight his Battles, then his greateſt Enemies were able to diſmay him. And according to his Confidence, was his ſucceſs; for there we read in the end, he recovered his Loſſes, and quite ſubdued his Foes. And therefore, amidſt all your fores, think not on your own wounds, but your Redeemers: If Satan, by his Emiſſaries; ſhould deſtroy your bodies, he hath done the like to your Lord and Saviour;

            <p>If at any time he's compelled to let fall a few drops of ſeverity, even that little Gall is mingled with much Hony; that bitter water, iſſues out of a ſweet Fountain; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reprehenſion of his, proceeds from a loving affection. Well may this form and ſtile of preaching, be the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when it was the Bleſſed <hi>Trinitie's</hi> in example. God the <hi>Father,</hi> came in a ſoft and ſtill voyce; God the <hi>Son,</hi> figur'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not as a <hi>Tyger,</hi> but a <hi>Lamb;</hi> God the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> appeared not in the ſhape of a <hi>Vulture,</hi>

Bitter Pills are uſed to be adminiſtred in ſweet Sirrups, without any loſs of their Vertue or Operation; and I never heard that the influence of a gentle perſwaſion, was any diſparagement or prejudice to the cauſe. So that <hi>captare benevolentiam,</hi> to work a mans ſelf into the good liking of his Auditors, is a rule not onely preſcribed for the <hi>Orator,</hi> but <hi>Divine</hi> too. The caſe is the ſame in both, becauſe if they like not the <hi>Man,</hi> they will not care for the <hi>Matter.</hi> Wherefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth not mean we ſhould ſpeak ſlovingly, when in the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he renounced the entiſing
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170448:104"/>words of man's wiſdom; for who ſees not that an uncouth and bald expreſſion, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhapes good matter, and in ſtead of edifying, deafs mens ears? The Apoſtle denyed, That by the ſtrength of their own Eloquence, they had ſtrength to win ſouls to Chriſt; but yet himſelf accounted and uſed the <hi>beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of ſpeech, as a help to our Converſion. And ſo, from the Porch and Entrance of my Text, let's go in and behold the Building. From this Compellation, <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi> we may obſerve who are included within theſe Promiſes; and they, upon the firſt view, appear to be no other then We, <hi>WE having,</hi> or <hi>ſeeing WE have.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Faith and Charity keep a different Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect; the voyce of Faith is <hi>Ego, I,</hi> with an appropriation to our ſelves; the Language of Charity is <hi>Nos, We,</hi> with a Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to others: <hi>It ſeeks not her own,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. Now as Charity knows no bounds, ſo <hi>Nos</hi> no reſtriction. It is <hi>Nos</hi> in the largeſt Latitude, and utmoſt extenſion, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends Jews and Gentiles. We hold not in ſpecial, but in common; and ſo we are not to ſtraighten and contract our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours Bowels, when he hath enlarged them; nor to make an encloſure of theſe Promiſes, which he hath laid open: to day, and yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and from the beginning of the world he hath been liberal unto all. In <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> there was a Tree of Life, as well as of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Ever ſince, as there hath been a Law
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170448:105"/>to inſtruct, ſo there hath been provided a Tree of Life too, that man might eat of it, and live for ever; even the <hi>Lamb</hi> ſlain from the beginning of the world. Our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had the <hi>Redeemer</hi> aſſured by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed of the VVoman; <hi>Enoch,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth from <hi>Adam,</hi> remembred it: thoſe were called the <hi>Sons</hi> of God, which could not be but by Grace; the Law made them not Sons. After the Flood, <hi>Noah,</hi> with his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Family, offered Sacrifice; which was a Type of Chriſt. All our Fathers did eat the ſame ſpiritual Meat, and they drank of the ſame ſpiritual Rock, and that Rock was Chriſt. It was propheſied long before he came, that all fleſh ſhould ſee the <hi>Salvation of God,</hi> Lev. 3. After he was come, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, at the day of Pentecoſt, were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated with all Tongues, that Chriſt, by them, ſhould be conveyed to all Nations. Seeing then he hath vouchſafed the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Means of Salvation to attract all, <hi>Go, and preach to ALL nations;</hi> ſo it runs in the Commiſſion; and dayly invites All to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace them: without queſtion both Jews and Gentiles have a Right and Title to theſe Promiſes. The King, in the Parable, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. bids <hi>ALL</hi> to the Marriage; his will was, none ſhould be debarred, but ſuch as cared not to bring along with them their Wedding-Garment: So the great <hi>King</hi> of Heaven, invites every one to the Marriage of the <hi>Lamb;</hi> he admits All to his heavenly
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170448:105"/>Table; he rejects none but onely ſuch, who under-value, and caſt behind them, the All-healing Robe of Chriſts Righteouſneſs. If the Redeemer of Man-kind, when he ſaw us weltring in our own blood, drawing in corruption faſter then our breath, had caſt his ſaving Mantle ſhort of the mark, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unwilling to cover the skirts, as well as the head of prevaricating <hi>Adam,</hi> the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, as well as the Jews, the Playſter had been leſs then the wound; and the ſight of ſuch a Medicine might have made the caſe more lamentable; and in ſtead of curing, enraged the diſeaſed. But to prevent all querulous murmuring, it pleaſed our Saviour to be made a little lower then the Angels, that he might taſte death for every man, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. For he would have no man to periſh, but <hi>that all ſhould come to Repentance,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. not caſting away any until <hi>there be no remedy;</hi> and that's chronicled too, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.13.
<note place="margin">See D. Prof. Rep. ad Object. Vincen.</note> So that their blood may be on their own heads, and deſtruction from themſelves. Indeed, <hi>Job</hi> tells us, That <hi>the Oſtrich leaves her Eggs in the earth, and forgets that the foot might ſcatter them, or that the wild Beaſts might break them,</hi> Job 39. She ſhews her ſelf cruel to her young ones, as if they were not hers; and is without fear, as if ſhe travelled in vain. But our <hi>Maker</hi> is of a melting diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, grieving ſo oft as he is forced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure grief to any; which makes him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie his Compaſſion, by parallelling it
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170448:106"/>to a <hi>Hen, Mat.</hi> 23. a Creature moſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate to her brood: the wings of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy being always diſplayed to hide every one from the day of wrath, unleſs it be them, the full meaſure of whoſe iniquity makes them deſperately to cry out,
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 12.</note> 
               <hi>What portion have we in David? we have no Inheritance, no part in him.</hi> Hence it is, that in the ſecond to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> he is ſaid to take upon him the <hi>ſeed</hi> of <hi>Abraham.</hi> Our ſeed is apprehended, that part which is common to us all, that part where we began to tranſgreſs, that ſo the gift might not be perſonal, but redound to all. And yet, though he took on him our ſeed, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it is ſtiled The ſeed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For albeit <hi>Adams</hi> fleſh is united, yet <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> ſeed is named; as if mankind then began, when Faith began to flouriſh. None could carry away the Name in the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, before the Father of the Faithful: So that <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtands for a whole world; <hi>I am the God of Abraham.</hi> He took upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that the world might know thereby how the promiſe was not made to his fleſh, but to his Faith. And therefore, though theſe promiſes in Chriſt are unfainedly proclaimed to All; yet, becauſe not truly apprehended by All, the participation is not all alike.

               </note> If you have an intuitive eye on the Oblation it ſelf, Dr. <hi>Proſper</hi> will have that to be for the whole world; but if you reflect on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170448:106"/>eſtimable benefit, that's found onely in the Elect. And why? The world lying in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, would have none of it; ſo that in his ſence, the Saviour of the world could not but affirm, that he came to ſave onely the ſheep that were loſt of the houſe of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> all others deſpiſing the riches of his Goodneſs. He graciouſly wooed, they graceleſly rejected him. Nevertheleſs, he dyed not altogether in vaine, though his Death proved not their Life, no more then he can be ſaid in vain to have created to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting bliſs, the Angels that fell; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Wiſdom of the Lord hereby to make manifeſt, that the default was not on his part, but on their own neglect and contempt of his Croſs: ſome putting him away quite, others confeſſing him with their mouths, but not permitting him to raigne in their hearts. Our Lord, by uniting to his perſon that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is common to us all, and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring death for the ſame cauſe, whereunto we all hold up our hands, and plead guilty, may truely, ſaith <hi>Proſper,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Proſ. ut ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> be called the Redeemer of the world. But in regard All do not taſte the fruit of his paſſion, the benefit accrues to them, concerning whom it's written, That <hi>the Prince of this world is caſt out;</hi> they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone applying his Merits to heal their Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. For as the Cup of Salvation is fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to him, the faith of whoſe ſoul is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to receive it; ſo likewiſe is Chriſts Oblation.</p>
            <pb n="204" facs="tcp:170448:107"/>
            <p>Upon this Argument, the Apoſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forceth his Exhortation; Seeing we have not any bare or naked Title, but our <hi>Tenure</hi> is in the validity of theſe Promiſes; ſeeing we boaſt to have the life of grace in us, which the diſ-inherited have not, <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves.</hi> And ſurely there's not a ſtronger Motive to ſtir up our practiſe of this Duty, then theſe few words, that we challenge an intereſt in <hi>theſe Promiſes.</hi> If entituled to Chriſt, where then is his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter? where's the Diſcipline of Chriſt? Superficial ſanctity, and titular reſpects, make us no better then ſome <hi>Apothecaries</hi> Boxes, whoſe glorious inſcriptions, and var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out-ſides, are inwardly ſtored with nothing but hypocriſie and emptineſs.</p>
            <p>Theſe Promiſes are ſingular Promiſes, and worthy Gods performance onely. VVho would have thought that the Red-Sea could have been divided? the weak water, which is moved with a Feather, ſhould ſerve as a pavement to walk upon? that the Snn ſhould ſtay his Courſe, as it were forgetting his going down? that water ſhould abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly ſtreame from the flinty Rocks? Theſe the Almighty promiſed; and according to his Promiſe, effected. <hi>Seeing then we have theſe ſingular promiſes, let <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S cleanſe our ſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe promiſes, are ſpecial <hi>Promiſes;</hi> God rules us not as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ruled <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a Rod of Iron, toyling them in their
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170448:107"/>task of Brick, and allowing no Straw; but he commends our well-doing, and helps us to do it. He infuſeth his aſſiſting Grace, to keep us from the danger of a relapſe; and ſtrengthneth the weakneſs of our Nature, which upon every temptation is ready to ſtart back. And when all that is done, is done by our native Allegeance; yet his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral bounty ſurpaſſeth our conceiving; when for a broken ſervice on earth, he makes a promiſe of Heaven. Seeing then we have theſe precious Promiſes, let's be ſure to cleanſe our ſelves; for <hi>no unclean thing enters into the heavenly gate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe promiſes are moſt certain Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, as proceeding from his immutable will. Hence it is, that although Fleſh and Blood, in our beſt Contemplations, meet with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties, and reaſon and ſenſe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend many impoſſibilities; yet, under hope, we believe above hope, and give God the glory. <hi>Abraham</hi> conſidered not his own body, how it was dead; he regarded not the deadneſs of <hi>Sarahs</hi> Womb; nay, when the heavy Mandate to kill and ſacrifice his one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> did ſeem to contradict the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, That <hi>in Iſaac all the Nations ſhould be bleſſed;</hi> yet the <hi>Patriarch</hi> believes beyond all impoſſibilities, reſting on this ſure foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and unmoveable, <hi>Faithful is he which promiſeth,</hi> Heb. 10. And thus the true ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> do not ſtagger at the horror of their ſeparation, nor the uglineſs of death,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170448:108"/>nor the corruption of their fleſh, nor the rortenneſs of their bones, nor the duſt and aſhes whereinto they muſt be diſſolved; they anchor and faſten on this ground, All theſe promiſes are certain, they are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi> In the horror of the Grave, they are the ſeed of Immortality, which is ſown with us, and makes us hope to ſpring up anew to eternal Glory.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe promiſes are moſt certain, as ariſing from his will; ſo they are unfained, and void of all Sophiſtry, as proceeding from his Verity. The promiſes of the world are ſmooth and counterfeit; fair in pretence, empty of performance. They are but skin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deep; put them to the Piercer, make tryal of them, they are without blood. They gnaw on the bark, there's no ſap in them; it being the Complement of too many, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe any thing for preſent ſatisfaction. The Tongues of a great part, are tipt with <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianiſm,</hi> you muſt not ſhew your ſelves ſo rude, as to entertain their courteſies; for they, like to our <hi>Oar-men,</hi> look one way, and row another.</p>
            <p>I remember <hi>Barclay,</hi> in his <hi>Icon Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> relates how the <hi>Italians,</hi> when they are moſt offended, will make the largeſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of humanity; that ſo, by the priviledge of friendſhip, they may the more ſubtly work their revenge. But our Lord God is not carried away with any fluctuation, but remains continually firm upon his Square.
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170448:108"/>He urgeth, and ſeriouſly preſſeth, to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of his willing profers: To this end he ſtretcheth out his hands all the day long, ſends forth his meſſengers early and late, to convince ſinners, to terrifie and ſhame them out of their ſinful courſes. <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3 <hi>chap.</hi> 9 <hi>verſ.</hi> abundantly teſtifies it: Firſt, Negatively, <hi>The Lord is not willing that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhould periſh;</hi> having no primary intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or antecedent thought of their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before they give occaſion. Then he proves Affirmatively, That the will of God hath a poſitive act in procuring their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; becauſe he wills that <hi>all ſhould come to repentance.</hi> Well might he ſay, ſaith <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard,</hi> That he <hi>will not the death of a ſinner,</hi> who dyed himſelf to ſave ſinners. In the 23 Chapter of this propheſie, verſ. 11. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts, and confirms it with an Oath, to make his promiſe more firm and ſtable; <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I do not delight in the death of the wicked:</hi> Yea, rather then he will fail in his purpoſe of doing his people good, he falls to expoſtulations, urgeth them to give any colour of reaſon, why they will rather periſh in ſin, then be reconciled to him: <hi>Why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> Is there no hope? will ye not return? will nothing prevaile with you? no means? no promiſes of ſaving mercies? no threatnings? no judgements? will ye not enter into Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with me? why will ye not? <hi>Why will ye dye, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> So in the ſixth
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170448:109"/>of <hi>Micah,</hi> and the third, <hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I wearied thee? come and teſtifie againſt me.</hi> As if the Lord had ſaid, <hi>What could I have done more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it?</hi> I have offered Mercy, and it hath been refuſed; gracious helps and means, and neglected; bleſſings, and not regarded: I have waited for your Converſion, and ye have not returned. And what is there in all this, that makes you ſo unwilling to lay down your weapons of Rebellion, that ye have taken up againſt me? And leſt ſome ſhould charge God fooliſhly, that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes are but ſhadows, like to mans impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures, in the 25 verſe, he juſtifies himſelf and his dealings with them: <hi>Hear now, O houſe of Iſrael; Is not my way equal? are not your ways unequal?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed, ſeeing a double heart, which harbours honey in the mouth, and gall in the breaſt, is abominable before him; how can it be thought he ſhould promiſe one thing, and will the contrary? <hi>Non mutat voluntatem, ſed vult mutationem,</hi> as Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſſeth it;
<note place="margin">De civ. Dei.</note> he doth not change his will, but wills a change; the alteration is not in the Diſpoſer of the thing, but in the thing diſpoſed of. And therefore, when Saint <hi>James</hi> calls him The <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> he preſently adds the propriety of the Sun, that fountain of Light, with whom is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſs, nor ſhadow of change. Indeed,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170448:109"/>the Moon alters nothing, but ſhe is firſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered her ſelf: if ſhe cauſe a flux and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flux of humors below, ſhe waxeth and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in her light above. But the Sun, which ſo turneth the hue of all this lower world, continues ſtill the ſame; and when it ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth moſt, is ne'er the warmer. So the Lord, upon ſome occurrences, changeth his Creatures, continuing himſelf unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Doth he promiſe Life, and yet inflicts Death? That promiſed Bleſſing, was upon condition of our obedience; ſo that if we perform not the condition, no marvel if we fail of theſe promiſes. Seeing then we have theſe unfained promiſes, let us not be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to our ſelves, but let us fall to our work, which conſiſts in the Act of Renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Let us cleanſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You ſee the Connexion and Dependance of the words; it is not, Having theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, let us <hi>defile</hi> our ſelves, but, let us <hi>cleanſe</hi> ourſelves. The Liberty of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, implies not looſeneſs, but holineſs. Theſe promiſes are the ground of our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Obedience is the firſt ſtep to the Throne. It is the true Badge and Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of a Chriſtian; it was Chriſts in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, it muſt be ours in Imitation. It is the Kings High-way to Heaven, the way beaten out unto us by the Kings own Son; with whom, if we will raign, we muſt cleanſe ourſelves, and crucifie the <hi>old man</hi> within us; with a godly revenge, executing thoſe
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170448:110"/>Offences which would have condemned us. We are to put off the <hi>old man,</hi> as we do our Garments, orderly, and by parts; now clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing one ſin, then another, until we have freed our ſelves from their accurſed League. All the Levitical cleanneſs under the Law, the waſhing of the Prieſts, cleanſing of the people, of the Altar, the Temple, the Gates and Entrances of their Houſes; What were they, but ſo many myſteries of their purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the turpitude and deformity of ſin? God requires the ſame of us in ſubſtance, which was prefigured in theſe Ceremonies. The Altar is our heart; the Houſe of the Lord, our bodies and ſouls, which are the temples of the Holy Ghoſt; the People and Gates, are we here aſſembled, whom of no people, he hath made a people, that we ſhould be holy as he is holy, ſanctifying our Affections and Actions, which are the Gates and Doors through which the Spirit of Grace is to go in and out. Chriſt hath not redeemed us to be altogether ſedentary, dull and lazie; but to be Operative, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with good works. It is true, God gives the Ability; yet he will have us to make uſe of it. He will not take all the pains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and leave us idlely to depend on him. For to ſit our ſelves down, and lay all on the Divine Providence, is juſt the ſluggiſh Knave in the Fable; who, when his Cart was overthrown, would needs have his God <hi>Hercules</hi> come down from Heaven, to raiſe
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170448:110"/>it up againe, whiles himſelf would be Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and give aime. The Members of Chriſt are not Stocks and Stones, inſenſible, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtudying of goodneſs; they are not <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culnus, inutile lignum,</hi> like the Image of <hi>Baal,</hi> and the Stump of <hi>Dagon;</hi> they will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Graces they have received, to ſleep in them, but will put their hands to the plow, and labour in the Vineyard.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge the neceſſity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Grace, for the Inchoation or begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of what is good: we believe there muſt be his Co-operating Grace, to aſſiſt our well-doing; and his ſubſequent Grace, to perfect this mundifying or cleanſing work. For it lyes not in mans will, nor in his run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; but in the Mercy of God, the onely Sufficient and Efficient cauſe of Renovation to Life eternal. Therefore, ſaith God to his people, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43. <hi>I, even I am he, that puts away thy Iniquity for my own ſake.

            <p>Up then, ſluggiſh ſoul; ariſe, thou that ſleepeſt, unfold thy hands, and gird they ſelf to the Battle: behold, thy Enemy hath entrenched thee, thy fleſh hath compaſſed in thy ſoul; and now the onely means to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due it, is to purge and cleanſe all peccant humors. The very word doth import, that the Apoſtle intends not the deſtruction, but the obedience of the body; that as the body received life and motion from the ſoul, ſo it might return a willing ſervice. For God, who requires our bodies as a reaſonable and living Offering, means not we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them in our humiliation, or with a careleſs diſ-reſpect, quire put off man, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Chriſtians.

A foul practiſe, under a fair pretence. If things be thus or thus ordered, what's that to thee? There are imperfections and defects
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170448:111"/>enough in thy own boſome. How many are the corruptions exalted againſt obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be ſubdued? how many infirmities to be bewailed? But it is the diſtempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mindes diſcontented at any thing preſent, to be alwaies diſcuſſing what they obſerve without, ſeldome or never taking a diligent ſurvey of their own weakneſſes that are within. They are wont to have Lyncean Eyes to others; more eyes then the Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard hath ſpots, not a more ſhall eſcape their cenſure; but as blind as Moles to themſelves, more blind then <hi>Bartimeus,</hi> which knew not Men from Trees. They cannot ſee beams at home; the reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are in love with the property of the eye, which ſees all but it ſelf. Indeed, the eye ſees it ſelf; yet not <hi>per lineam di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectam,</hi> but by reflexion: ſo they ſee their own enormities, yet not <hi>per radios directos;</hi> but <hi>per ambages, &amp; circumloquia.</hi>

            <p>Neither will they ſee them ſo, till judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments force them, till they be brought upon their knees. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the eighth of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus,</hi> becomes ſomewhat tractable; but it is when a ſtorm drives him to it. <hi>Balaam,</hi> in the twenty ſecond of <hi>Numbers,</hi> bows, and gives good words; but it is when danger is near him, otherwiſe they will diſguiſe their impiety.

            <p>It ſhall be our care to dive into our own breaſts, to ſit in the Watch-tower of our own hearts, viewing and rectifying the relapſes and declinations of our ſelves. If aſperſions be caſt upon our beſt Actions; what a joy will it be, that we ſhould be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Goodneſs, and be made to commit Charity? Thus the Diſciples of Chriſt knew nothing of the State, they ſtudied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſaying, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> Mat. 26.

            <p>The ſummons ſhall be, <hi>Give an account of thy own ſtewardſhip.

            <p>The uglineſs of ſin appears by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Names and Characters wherewith 'tis branded in the Scriptures. In the ſixteenth of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> it's compared to the pollution of a <hi>new born Child.</hi> In the thirty ſixth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the ſame Prophet likens it to the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a <hi>removed woman.</hi> In the firſt of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170448:113"/>
               <hi>John,</hi> to the rottenneſs of man in his <hi>grave. David,</hi> viewing the deformity of his ſins, roars for the diſquietneſs of his heart, findes no reſt in his bones; which made him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the Lord to cover them, and blot them all quite out. It is too manifeſt, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny harbor ſome one corrupt affection as their darling; and becauſe they are fortified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aſſault of all others, they make fair weather withal, and think all is well with them. The ſtarved Niggard, falls foul upon the full Epicure, and the Epicure jeeres the Niggard. The Covetous counts himſelf a good Chriſtian, becauſe he is not deboſh'd, not given to licentiouſneſs. And the Voluptuous would be eſteemed a good Chriſtian too, in that he abhors all wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fordidneſs. This party, and delicate o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, ſupplicates to God for a diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Naaman</hi>'s form: <hi>When I bow my knee to Rimmon,</hi> ſaid he; to <hi>Mammon,</hi> ſaith the Covetous; to <hi>Bacchus,</hi> ſaith the Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; to <hi>Venus,</hi> ſaith the Libidinous; to <hi>Mars,</hi> ſaith the Furious; <hi>God be merciful to me in this.</hi> But the true Convert is at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance with each ſin; he remembers how <hi>Herod,</hi> a man that never knew the power of goodneſs, in many things heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly; yet, in one thing, he would be <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> ſtill, in his filthy inceſt he would be no Changeling. Whereupon, the regenerate Chriſtian reſerves no peculiar Cloſet for any boſome ſin; for he conſiders, if we leave
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170448:114"/>but one inlet of out ſouls open to folly, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, that old Serpent, who lyes in ambuſh for all advantages, may as well by that, creep in, to our perdion, as by many apparent brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. The Ship may be ſunk by ſome little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleleak, as well as by the violence of the waves breaking in upon it. The leaſt drachm of poyſon is enough to infect the ſoundeſt Conſtitution. One prevailing Diſeaſe, may kill the body, as well as many: ſo one <hi>Dali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah,</hi> one corrupt luſt adhering to us, will deſtroy both body and ſoul, no leſs then a multitude of ſins: the reaſon is, becauſe the leaſt ſin is as mortal in it's nature, as the greateſt. Hence it was, that Chriſt ſuffered exactly in every part, and roſe again com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly with all his parts, to ſhew that we alſo, who are Chriſts, ſhould be throughly mortified to ſin in all parts, and cuickned to righteouſneſs in every point. The body is not ſound, ſo long as the remainder of a Diſeaſe neſtles in it; no more can our ſouls be clean, if one corner be left unſwept.</p>
            <p>In the natural body, if one part be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding hot, and the reſt exceeding cold, it is a ſymptome of ſome diſtemper within; but if there be an equal temper of heat throughout, then all is well. So it is in the ſpiritual man; if our blood ſhall riſe at the hearing of an Oath, and yet can be content to cheat our neighbour; that's a ſigne all is not well within, becauſe true obedience muſt be in all integrity. For ſeeing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170448:114"/>made every part and faculty of our bodies and ſouls, and uſed no partner in the work, he will never admit the <hi>Devil</hi> as a Cope-mate to part ſtakes with him; but like the true Mother of the Child, will <hi>have all or none.</hi> Thus we read that Chriſt caſt out of <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> ſeven Divels,
<note place="margin">Mar 16.</note> he left not one: he caſt a Legion of Devils out of another, not one was left behind;
<note place="margin">Mar. 5.</note> to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon us wholly to put off the old man, and whatſoever hath any affinity with ſin and Satan, as the <hi>Romans</hi> expelled the whole Race of the <hi>Tarquins</hi> out of <hi>Rome.</hi> Our purgative therefore muſt be general, from <hi>ALL filthineſs,</hi> and that <hi>of the fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> which are the parts ſo much infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>The fleſh is ſometimes taken in Scripture for the general Maſs of Corruption, as it is repugnant to the Law. So the Apoſtle, in the fifth to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> reckons Pride, Envy, and ſuch like, among the works of the fleſh: yet <hi>fleſh</hi> here, paſſeth for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, which, with the ſoul, builds up the whole Man, in regard 'tis put directly oppoſite to the Spirit. And well it may be ſo put; for this pollution of the fleſh, which cleaves to the ſubſtance as Chaff to the Wheat, hath depraved our whole Nature; and ſo, not our hands onely, but our hearts too; as well the inward man, as the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; the inſide, no leſs then the outſide, muſt be cleanſed and purified.</p>
            <pb n="220" facs="tcp:170448:115"/>
            <p>I finde it ſtoried of devout <hi>Anſelm,</hi> how, on a certain time, he caſt his eye on a Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds Boy; who, having caught a Bird, tyed a ſtone to the leg, by which means the Bird could no ſooner mount and ſoar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loft, but the ſtone drew her down again: And ſo that holy Arch-Biſhop, having a ſympathy or feeling of humane infirmities, fell a weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and condoled the miſerable ſtate of Man by Nature, who could no ſooner by pious Contemplations endeavour to aſcend into heaven, but his Corruptions forthwith enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to the earth. The noyſome ſteam and exhalations of our ſenſual affections, cloud the rational faculty or power of our Reaſon, and ſo damps the clearneſs of her operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>It's worth the while to eye the order of the words, <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs:</hi> Firſt, of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> then of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the rebellious motions of the fleſh being the matter and fuel of ſin. Our fleſh is both our worſt, and neareſt enemy; and the worſt, becauſe our neareſt. VVell may the whole life of Man be called a continual warfare here on Earth, ſince every one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his greateſt Adverſary in his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. And upon very good ground is Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſaid to be got by violence, when our own fleſh, like a ponderous and maſſie weight, is repreſſing us from aſpiring thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I cannot now wonder, that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as one amaz'd and much aſtoniſh'd,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170448:115"/>breaks forth into this paſſionate exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the body of this death?</hi> Seeing the Law of the Members hinders the good which we would do, and drives us to the evil we would not do.</p>
            <p>Now if it much humbled <hi>Abraham</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member he was but duſt and aſhes;
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.27.</note> far more it ſhould humble us, knowing we are much worſe, lumps of ſin and corruption: Our bodies and ſouls being no better then <hi>Sterquilinium ſuper ſterquilinium,</hi> one dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill tumbled upon another. As for thoſe wrangling diſputes, Whether the firſt moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the fleſh be formally or materially, properly or improperly ſins, let them take their reſt; it's truly concluded on all ſides, and every one muſt be abundantly ſenſible, that they are <hi>fomes peccati,</hi> the Matter, the Tinder, Womb of all ungodlineſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are abſolutely to be curbed, not once to be admitted, or at leaſt preſently expelled. <hi>Elias</hi> cloud was but a little one at firſt;
<note place="margin">1 Kin. 18.</note> yet afterwards it became a covering for the whole heaven. And ſo the ſmalleſt ſparke of ill motions, may burn into a vaſt flame. For ſin is of a ſpreading Nature, it never ſtays where it begins. Give but the leaſt Serpent room for his head, and he will eaſily winde in his whole body. The heart being once defiled, vve yeild our members vvea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of uncleanneſs to uncleanneſs; ſo fruitful and teeming a Mother is the inbred
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170448:116"/>Concupiſcence of our inordinate Nature. When ſinful motions ſpring up, uſe them as <hi>Hercules</hi> uſed the two Snakes, ſtrangle them in the Cradle, in the ſwathing band, in the very beginning.</p>
            <p>Tvvo main enemies to this Act of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation, or cleanſing the luſts and vicious habits of the fleſh and ſpirit, are intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Eating, and immoderate Drinking. For the body carries the ſoul, as the Horſe the Rider; vvhich, if too vvantonly fed, vvill either run avvay, or dangerouſly throvv him. A ſurfeited and unruly body, is no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation for the ſoul; but a priſon, a place onely to encloſe the ſpirit, not to entertain it. When the belly is fulleſt, there is moſt room for Satan; becauſe the ſoul is never more fraught with ſin, then when the fleſhly Epicure is moſt diſtended with meat. Let him be glutted, and all the day after will ſerve for nothing but to ſin, or at leaſt to ſleep in. To this purpoſe Satan ſet on <hi>Jobs</hi> Children in the place of their banqueting, and made their Table their Snare, their Dainties their Bane. Let not us then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſin by the ſame trade our firſt Parents purchaſed it, by eating; for the time will come, when God will deſtroy the belly, and the meat; when the very fleſh, ſo careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained, will ſerve for nothing but to maintain the VVorms that deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>The other Capital Vice which croſſeth Mortification, is immoderate uſing of Drink<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:170448:116"/>They are both near of blood: For what is a Clutton, but <hi>Qui menſuram ſtomachi non novit,</hi> who delights in nothing but eating and drinking? Would you know why the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day is better known to the Drunkard by the Ale-houſe, then the Church? The Devil hath taken poſſeſſion in his ſwiniſh breſt; and that makes him ſtill run headlong to thoſe waters. It is true,
<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Judith</hi> 13.2.</note> that <hi>Judith</hi> killed <hi>Holofernes;</hi> but we read that the wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan his death. It were good then to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> preſcription, <hi>Be ſober,
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.5.</note> and watch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The better to prevent the like incurſions upon the whole man, the Forts and bulwarks of the ſoul, the exterior ſenſes, are to be well manned and kept ſafe. The ear and the eye are the two ſpecial inlets to all Treaſons and Conſpiracies againſt the fleſh and the ſpirit. It is hard to ſay where lies the more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: ſure I am, the lower houſe maſters the upper; the Law of the members exact obedience of the Law of the mind, the fleſh of the Spirit. <hi>Job,</hi> in his twelfth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, makes the ear the Taſter of the ſoul, as the mouth is for the belly; as if no word went down to the heart, but what the ear approves. Now, if the heart be full, the mouth muſt vent, if not run over; and if the tongue be wide, the ear will be wide too. This makes profaneneſs, which is a pain to the Chriſtian, a paſtime to the Carnal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we delight to ſpeak of thoſe things
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170448:117"/>whereof we delight to hear. Hence is it' that the Tale-teller, and the Tale-receiver, are of as near confederacy, as the Thief and the Receiver, inſeparable companions, ſworn brothers.
<note place="margin">In Cant.</note> Devout <hi>Bernard</hi> makes no more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them but this; the one car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the Devil in his Tongue, the other in his Ear. Take then Saint <hi>Luke</hi> for your Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
<note place="margin">Luk. 8.18.</note> who bids you <hi>take heed how you hear.</hi> For ſeeing Nature hath left the ear without any door or ſtop, the leaſt ſound which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proacheth thoſe trenches, may be admitted without reſiſtance. If it be not a clear ſound, then <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, rottenneſs of ſpeech is like to convey corruption of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. But upon better view, we finde the eye the arrantſt traytor; the eaſieſt entrance for aſſaults againſt the fleſh and the ſpirit, lyes that way.</p>
            <p>The eyes are the windows of the ſoul; and if the windows be not ſhut cloſe, or well guarded, acceſs will be wrought for dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies. It may be queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever ſin had took footing in the world, had it not crept in by the windows of the eye? That which firſt induced <hi>Eve</hi> to taſte the forbidden Fruit, was this: She ſaw 'twas goodly to the eye. VVhat brought <hi>Achan</hi> into deſtruction, but the waving up and down of his Eye? So ſoon as he ſaw the VVedge of Gold, and the Babyloniſh Garment, his deſires were enflamed, and ſteal he muſt. VVho knows not that <hi>Davids</hi> eyes were
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170448:117"/>a burning-glaſs to ſet both body and ſoul in Combuſtion? For collecting the beams of <hi>Bathſheba</hi>'s ſhining beauty, he was ſet on fire with that was precious in her. And ſo, by the ſparkling lure of the eye, <hi>Bathſhcba</hi> loſt her honour, and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> his head.</p>
            <p>I could ſhew you how we read in Saint <hi>John,</hi> of the luſt of the eye; in Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> of the adultery of the eye; and how <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> forbidding to look on the wine while it is red, and ſparkling in the Cup, intimates there is a drunkenneſs of the eye. And though it was <hi>Seneca</hi>'s reproof, an Apoſtle might have owned it, <hi>Etiam oculis guloſt ſunt;</hi> it may be truely ſaid, that, in ſome ſenſe, there is gluttony in the eye. Such a Maſs of Corruption lies lurking in the little Orb of the Eye:
<note place="margin">Job 31.</note> ſo that <hi>Jobs</hi> reſolution may be ours, which is to make a Covenant with our Eyes, not to take in theſe treacherous Temptations, leſt the alluring blandiſhments of the fleſh, which paſs through the eye, do quench the ſpirit. For as there are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal delights, wherewith the body is chiefly infected; ſo there are the ſpiritual impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties wherewith the ſpirit is defiled. <hi>Illa majoris ſunt infamiae haec culpae;</hi> carnal ſins bring greater infamy and ſhame unto men, but the ſpiritual leave a greater blot imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted within. Thoſe make men like Beaſts, but ſpiritual uncleanneſs make men like De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Therefore let's cleanſe our ſelvs from all filthineſs, not onely of the fleſh, but of
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:170448:118"/>
               <hi>the Spirit,</hi> which is the other part put oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the fleſh.</p>
            <p>Here the Curioſity of the School is much troubled, how the Soul, being a Spirit, and ſo immaterial, can receive contagion from the Fleſh. Much puzzling there is in looſing the knot, in determining the Controverſie. <hi>Aquinas,</hi> as I conceive, is moſt ſatisfying; who,
<note place="margin">1a 2ae q. 83. <hi>Artic.</hi> 13.</note> ſeating the ſubject of ſin in the body and ſoul united, imputes all that is amiſs to the Agency of the Spirits, hurrying in the ſeed. For theſe Spirits, ſaith he, being of a middle nature, betwixt the body and ſoul, and withal, the Inſtruments of Generation, do inſtantly convey the Species or Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſinful imaginations from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the Child, whereby all the faculties are ſuddenly depraved. But what need all this ado? We are ſure we are fallen into the puddle and filthy ſink of ſin; let's ſtrive more how to get out, then enquire how we fell in. It is a plain caſe, that Pride, Envy, and the like, are the Biles and Ulcers of the Soul; and therefore the Impoſthumation muſt be launc'd, the cure muſt be endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. The firſt turpitude of the Spirit, which comes to be cleanſed, is Pride. It was ſo bold as to intrude into heaven, and thence threw an Angel into hell.</p>
            <p>This ſhould abate the Creſt, and reverſe the Armes of the higheſt Spirit; for if God ſpared not his Angels, he will not ſpare the beſt of men, who are but duſt and aſhes,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170448:118"/>if their attempts be proud.</p>
            <p>Pride would be perking in Paradiſe, and forthwith <hi>Adam</hi> was caſt out. Mount not then aloft like an Egle,
<note place="margin">Deſiit eſſe quod erat, quia voluit eſſc quod non erat.</note> but conſider our firſt Father loſt the perfection of being inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, by aiming to be tranſcendent. It would ſet up its plumes in the Court, and ſo turn'd King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> a grazing. They then that are <hi>ſibi ipſis ſuffeni,</hi> ſmoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to themſelves, forgetting their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and their Maker, muſt know this, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo eſſe perdidit, quia ſe ultra hominem eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mavit;</hi> he became a Beaſt, that would needs be more then a Man.</p>
            <p>Of the ſame wing with Pride, is the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Vice of Envy. This is a deſtroyer, <hi>a murtherer from the beginning.</hi> Saint <hi>Baſil</hi> faies, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, are as like in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as in Name. They are Correlatives, ſlaughter being Envies intimate and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar. <hi>Cain</hi> firſt envies his Brother, then ſlew him. Envy is rightly called <hi>toxicum chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> the bane of Charity: for whereas Charity cauſeth us to rejoyce at the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of one another, this makes his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours welfare, the envious mans Diſeaſe. It excires them in whom it raigns, to deal with their brethren as the Jews did with Chriſt; who, when they came to ſpeak of his miracles and glorious works, were very remiſs and ſparing; then they concealed his Name, <hi>Hic Homo, this FELLOW doth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Miracles,</hi> John 11. But when they wrote
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170448:119"/>the Title of his faigned Crime upon the Croſs, there moſt maliciouſly they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his Name. <hi>Hic Homo</hi> would not ſerve the turn; but <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, King of the Jews;</hi> and that in three famous Tongues, Hebrew, Greek, and Latine; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten too in Capital Letters, that all men might run and read it.</p>
            <p>Yet of all Vices, this of Envy ſeems the juſteſt, in that it brings along with it its own Vengeance. For the envious man, becauſe he cannot conſume anothers heart, moſt viperouſly devours and eats out his own: like unto a Bee, who ſtinging another, loſeth at once her own ſtrength and life: Or like to Flies; who, while they ſtrive to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the light of others, torment and burn themſelves in the flame. Therefore God ſhould do great injury to the envious, if he placed them in Heaven, where is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Joy. For proſperity being the Object of Envy, it would encreaſe their ſorrow. Rightly then is hell allotted for ſuch Vipers, where they ſhall ſee nothing they may envy at. The ſafer to ſteer our courſe amidſt theſe corruptions of the fleſh and Spirit, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the fifth to the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latians,</hi> brings a Catalogue of ſpiritual fruits againſt the works of the fleſh. <hi>The fruit of the ſpirit,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is love, joy, gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, faith, temperance,</hi> and the like; in which fruits, if ye abide, ye ſhall never fall, but be partakers of the Divine Nature, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170448:119"/>eſcaped the pollutions which are in the world, through luſts,</hi> 1 Peter, Epiſt. 2.</p>
            <p>But this is not all; another ſtumbling block of offence is to be removed; and ſo much the rather, becauſe fleſh and blood either makes it a meer nothing, or ſo ſmall, as they think it ſhall never be brought to tryal; and that is the Thought of fleſh and blood.</p>
            <p>Our Thoughts, indeed, are free from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition in the Law of Man; they are not ſo in the Law of God. That calls to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination idle Thoughts, no leſs then idle words. For the intention of ill, as it is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to Gods Eyes, as the ill it ſelf; ſo 'tis as odious where 'tis nouriſhed in the heart with full conſent. A man may thus Think himſelf to hell: The reaſon is, becauſe, as in actions which be good, God accepts the deſire, where we want ability for the deed: ſo, in thoſe which are bad, his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments take hold of the thought, where we want means for the outward act. Our Saviour calls a luſtful thought adultery: St. <hi>John</hi> ſtiles a malicious thought murther. Well then may the Church pray, <hi>Cleanſe, O Lord, the thoughts of our hearts, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of thy holy Spirit, that we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly love thee;</hi> for unleſs theſe thoughts be purified, there will be no progreſs in good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, no perfecting of holineſs in the fear of God, the laſt and beſt part, it being the

            <p>After our Mortification, we muſt not ſtay there, as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did at the foot of the hill, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. but with <hi>Moſes,</hi> aſcend into the Mount of God, and improve our holineſs. The Iſraelites gathered Manna every day but on the Sabbath; to ſignifie, that until the everlaſting Sabbath of Reſt, there muſt be no ſtanding ſtill in our Chriſtian growth. They are but <hi>Embryo's</hi> in Religion; Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in their firſt Conception, who have their nouriſhment ſtill ſent into them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their Knowledge and will: at the beſt, but Babes, who are continually ſucking the Milk, the firſt Principles. Men of a full growth, perfect Men, are to digeſt ſolid Meat, fortifying the power of Chriſt that is in them by ſpiritual exerciſes. They, who aime to be glorious Citizens above, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed here, as the Sun, in a conſtant path, and grow in brightneſs till they attain the height of perfection. Boaſt not then of thy undaunted Faith, unmoveable Grace, for if thou doſt not long and endeavour to be encreaſed in Faith, and furthered in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; I doubt whether any ſpark of Faith, any atome or graine of Grace be in thee or no. That deſperate ſaying was the Devils dictating; <hi>I am predeſtinated to life, and ſo what matters my endeavour, I am ſure to be ſaved?</hi> For while we are <hi>Viatores,</hi>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:170448:120"/>Paſſengers on the way, it's good providence to fear as well as to hope.</p>

Indeed, I read that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteouſneſs of the Law, lived un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rebukably, even before he was converted: Mens eyes could ſpy no fault in him. In the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he proteſted that he knew nothing by himſelf. In the twenty fourth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he avows to the face of his moſt quick-ſighted Adverſaries, that he truly worſhipped the God of his Fathers, believing all things in the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, had hope in the reſurrection of the dead, and laboured to keep a clear Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards God and Man. In the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he takes the Elders of the Phariſees to witneſs after what manner he had lived with them at all ſeaſons, ſerving the Lord with all humility, and with many tears; and how he paſſed not for Bonds and Afflictions, neither was his life dear unto him, ſo that he might fulfil his courſe with Joy. When he was now ready to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up, and the time of his departing was
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170448:121"/>at hand, his Conſcience could give him this Teſtimony, <hi>I have fought a good fight, and finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith: from henceforth is laid up for me the Crown of righteouſneſs.</hi> And yet notwithſtanding all this his righteouſneſs, in the third to the <hi>Philippians</hi> he confeſſeth he hath not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that perfection of Grace he ought to labour for. And if not ſo, then out of his own mouth, he was not pure from ſin. For,

               <hi>quicquid minus eſt quam debet, ex vitio eſt;</hi> what we do not ſo well as we ought, we do amiſs. But if not Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> then who may phariſaically think himſelf perfect, or as the Angel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> wanting nothing? If any ſhould dare thus to over-value his borrowed Talents, he will ſhew a braine as empty of underſtanding, as a heart of Devotion. They magnifie the arm of fleſh, more then reaſon will admit, who, becauſe they finde ſome paſſages in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture concerning the innocency, juſtice and perfection of Gods Children, do ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply infer, That every jot and <hi>punctilio</hi> of the Law may be fulfilled.

In the former part of my Text, which is an Exhortation, there's an Act, the Act of <hi>humbling:</hi> the Object of that Act, <hi>your ſelves; humble your ſelves,</hi> not <hi>others:</hi> We have work enough at home, why ſhould we buſie our ſelves abroad about the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of our Brethren? The Motives indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this humiliating Act, are two; the one implied in the illative term, <hi>[therefore]</hi> God <hi>reſiſts the proud, humble your ſelves therefore:</hi> The order is expreſſed in the words which follow, <hi>under the mighty hand of God;</hi> Gods hand is mighty, <hi>therefore humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God.</hi>

            <p>The later part, which is the reaſon of the Exhortation, containes the honour indulged to the truly humbled, Exaltation; together with the Author thereof prefixed, <hi>that HE may exalt you;</hi> and in the cloſe is ſet down the opportunity of the time, <hi>in D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E time: Humble your ſelves therefore under the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Theme or Subject, is Humility, a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue more praiſed then practiſed; and yet 'tis a foundation whereon all other Chriſtian duties are builded. That this groundwork may be well laid, we are to conſider the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which comes by it. In the precedent Verſe, we are exhorted to deck our ſelves inwardly with lowlineſs. Indeed, our tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reads, <hi>Be cloth'd with humility;</hi> but the Original <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, ſignifies not ſimply clothing, but bedecking: the Apoſtle then eſteems it an Ornament, and that ſo beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and well-pleaſing in Gods Eye, that he adds grace unto it; <hi>He gives grace to the humble,</hi> ſaith that Verſe.</p>
            <p>The Scripture is copious in this point, that the heart which receives moſt from God, ever thinks leaſt of it ſelf. It was the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpeech of <hi>Abraham, I am but duſt and aſhes,</hi> Gen. 18. he's made the Father of the Faithful. It was the ſubmiſſive voyce of <hi>Jacob, I am leſs then the leaſt of Gods Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> Gen. 32. he's made his brothers lord. <hi>John</hi> acknowledgeth he is not worthy to
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:170448:123"/>looſe the Latchet of Chriſts Shooe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3. he's made his Redeemers <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> The <hi>Centurion</hi> cries out, He is not worthy Chriſt ſhould come under his roof, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is reſtor'd to health: a gracious reward of his lowlineſs. The bleſſed <hi>Virgin</hi> profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her ſelf the Lords <hi>Handmaid,</hi> ſhe's made the Mother of God incarnate. So true is that of Saint <hi>Auſtin, Qui ſibi diſpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet, Deo placet:</hi> To fall out with thy ſelf, is the next way to make God thy Friend. Thou ſhalt be ſo much more glorious in the ſight of the Lord, by how much the more contemptible and inconſiderable thou art in thy own eſtimate. It was <hi>Samuel</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'gatory to Saul, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15. <hi>When thou waſt little in thy own eyes, waſt thou not great in the eyes of God?</hi> All waters run naturally to deſcending places: ſo do the influences of ſupernatural graces to the lowly, who are as Vallies; not to the proud, who are as Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. A full Stomach will not digeſt more Meat: ſo a haughty minde is uncapable to receive any ſtore of bleſſings. The Phariſee thought himſelf full, he went home empty, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. One cauſe, ſaith <hi>Seneca,</hi> why men are not wiſe, is becauſe they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wiſe already; ſo many come not to their wiſh'd-for height, becauſe too ſoon they think ſo high of themſelves. He that will enter into a houſe with a low door, muſt firſt ſtoop; Chriſt is the door of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and he that will enter there by him,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170448:124"/>muſt of him learn to be <hi>lowly</hi> in heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.</p>
            <p>Many things teach us humility: Firſt, the Omnipotent Majeſty of God, in whoſe ſight the Stars, ſome tranſlate the Angels are unclean, <hi>Job</hi> 25. and therefore there is in us a nullity, in reſpect of his irreſiſtible great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Secondly, our Name, <hi>homo ab humo,</hi> bids us to reflect on the deſpicableneſs of our extraction, to deſcend <hi>in domum Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li,</hi> where we may find Clay, or the baſeſt of all Elements, Earth, to be the Original Matter of our firſt being. The conſideration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, forc'd the Perſian Emperour, haughty <hi>Xerxes,</hi> to pour out tears, in regard none of his formidable huge Army ſhould be alive within an hundred years; and thereupon to proclaim himſelf a King of Duſt, and not of Men. Again, the Contemplation of our Souls will help to humble us; the faculties whereof being ſore wounded, ſince our fall in <hi>Adam.</hi> The beſt rarities we have, are but <hi>dona,</hi> Gods donatives; they are given, and that <hi>ad Beneplacitum Dei,</hi> we have them not by Leaſe. Beſides, that which we know not, is more then that which we know; if one be wiſe, another is wiſer; and where's the more Grace, there's the more ſenſe of the want of it; therefore no cauſe to glory therein.</p>
            <p>Moreover, knowledge often begets a high conceit, <hi>Scientia inflat;</hi> Humility ſerves as a Pin to prick that windy Bladder of Knowledge.</p>
            <pb n="239" facs="tcp:170448:124"/>
            <p>Conſider likewiſe how the greatneſs of your endowments do greaten your burden, add to your charge, and enhaunſe the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning. <hi>For, to whom much is given, of him much is required.</hi> If thou haſt five Talents, thy Lord will look for the encreaſe of five, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. Do not then deſpiſe others, as lacking thoſe good parts, which you ſeem to have; but make your ſelves equal to them of the lower ſort, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. and in giving honour ('tis not in taking honour) go one before another, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. Experience alſo ſhews, that little Keyes are placed by the great; and little Pipes, with the great, make good Muſick: So it is in the condition of mans life, little and great, the mighty and the mean, ſort well together in mutual Offices.</p>
            <p>The leaſt member in the body, the leaſt pin in the building, the leaſt nayl in the work, hath its place and uſe; none are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. The favours which the humble enjoy, I conceive to be arguments to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble us. <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit: for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 5. as if it were prepared for none but ſuch. <hi>To him will I look, even to him that is of a poor and contrite ſpirit, and that trembleth at my words,</hi> Iſai. 66. As if God would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe none ſo much as a look, but the humble. VVhat ſhall I ſay of Chriſt, the exemplary pattern of Humility? Did thy Prince, being Lord of Lords, make himſelf of no repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation?

               </gap>, is a military word, ſignifying in order to ſet againſt: So that the Lord doth <hi>inſtruere aciam,</hi> even gather an army of his Creatures againſt the inſolent. He is not tyed to vindicate his honour meerly by an army of Men; he can raiſe an army of his loweſt Creatures, able enough to confound the proudeſt <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> the moſt deified <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods:</hi> an army of Flies, or an army of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſts; an army of Frogs, or an army of Lice; an army of Drops, or an army of Duſt: He can raiſe an army againſt the proud out of his own Fleſh; an army of VVorms, or an army of ſpots; an army of fiery In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, windy Convulſions, watry De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxions: He can raiſe an army out of his own ſoul; an army of vain Follies, and
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170448:125"/>ruinous Devices. <hi>If God be againſt us, who can be with us?</hi> Neither is he limitted to apparent and ſenſible ways, he can deſtroy the proud by <hi>ſecret and hidden</hi> blows. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was proud of his goodly and gorgeous building, a Voyce from Heaven ſaid, <hi>Thy Kingdom is departed from thee;</hi> and preſently he was exiled, and made free Deniſon of the fields ſeven years, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. This ſin hath a long repentance. <hi>Goli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> the glory of the Philiſtins, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted onely by a ſtone which was flung at him, and his own Sword cut off his head, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. <hi>Antiochus</hi> threatn'd to make <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> a common place of burial for the Jews; God ſmote him with an inviſible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable diſeaſe in his Bowels, wherewith he was tormented till his death, 2 <hi>Machab.</hi> 9.</p>
            <p>Secondly, God reſiſts the proud by hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their purpoſes: when <hi>Zenacharib,</hi> the proud King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> intended the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Jews, God, by his Angel, ſlew an hundred fourſcore and five thouſand of his Camp by night; and onely by the hearing of a noyſe, a blaſt, he was ſo ſcared, that he turned home into his own land, where he fell by the Sword of his own Sons, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. <hi>Saul</hi> proudly purpoſed <hi>Davids</hi> deſtruction;
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 23.27, 28.</note> a Meſſenger on the ſuddain tell'd him a Rumour, that the Philiſtins had invaded the Land, and he turns from purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="242" facs="tcp:170448:126"/>
            <p>Thirdly, God reſiſts the proud by turning their Counſels upon themſelves, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring them with their own miſchiefs. The proud Princes of <hi>Babylon</hi> condemned <hi>Dani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> to the Lyons Den; but the Lyons devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, their Wives and Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, God reſiſts the proud by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the things whereof they are proud. The Damſels of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are threatn'd to have all their bravery and ornaments tane away, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 3. The <hi>Cormorant,</hi> proud of his riches, was bereav'd of them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. So if we be proud of our ſtrength, God will take it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by ſickneſs; if of beauty, by an Ague or the ſmall Pocks; if of wit, by an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, or doting folly. It's evident, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighties word ſtands as a Law, which ſaith, <hi>He that exalts himſelf ſhall be brought low,</hi> Luk. 18. <hi>He that is proud, ſhall come to ſhame; nay, to deſtruction,</hi> Prov. 12. And thus, from the Argument of Illation by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, I proceed to the other Motive in regard of the mighty hand of God: <hi>Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelves therefore under the mighty hand of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But hath God a hand? Yes: as he hath an Eye, Foot, and the like; not properly, truly and literally; but improperly, figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, in a borrowed ſenſe, by way of ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude or reſemblance. So the Apoſtle, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the exerciſe of Gods ſupream pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſpeaks <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, after the manner
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:170448:126"/>of men, who are wont to be humbled by the hand. So when God by his mighty power dryed the Sea, ſoftned the Rocks, turned the River into Blood, ſtaid the Sun, darkn'd the Moon, and made the whole earth to tremble; the Pſalmiſt calls this might of his power, the might of his hand;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 11<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.15.</note> 
               <hi>The right hand of the Lord hath brought mighty things to paſs:</hi> It is the might and ſtrength of his power, which orders all things according to the Counſel of his own will. It is He who in due time will exalt us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He,</hi> not Chance or Fortune; but <hi>He,</hi> and <hi>He</hi> alone; ſhall <hi>exalt,</hi> not tread down; in <hi>due</hi> time, not perhaps in a time expected, but then, when it ſhall be more requiſite, more comfortable, even in <hi>due</hi> time. Now if all true advancement be from God, he then that is exalted, and not by the Lord, is exalted with a Vengeance. <hi>Haman</hi> was ſo highly exalted, that he was reputed as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the high:</hi> but becauſe it was not this <hi>HE</hi> in my Text who exalted him, all his honour quickly decay'd; for when he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be rais'd to the high ſeat of Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Halter was his comfort; they hang'd him on a Tree which he had prepared for <hi>Mordecai.</hi> How did <hi>Abimelech</hi> weary and waſte himſelf in obtaining a Kingdom? but becauſe he took not the right Method in coming to it by the Lord, the prime Author of all glory, all his pomp lay in the duſt: a ſilly woman caſt a piece of Milſtone upon
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170448:127"/>his head, and brake his Scull, which was the bane of all his hopeful endeavours, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9. In the eleventh of the ſecond of <hi>Kings, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaliah</hi> raigned. Queen over all the Land; but becauſe the Lord ſet her not up, but her own bloody Ambition, by deſtroying the Seed royal, not long after ſhe was ſlain by the Sword. Let us therefore rather want, then be great on any termes, which are not godly and righteous. It's better to endure poverty, then to be potent by parting with piety. The purchaſe is extreamly dear, when we part with our ſouls in the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</p>
            <p>Againe, it is <hi>He</hi> the LORD which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts; why then boaſteſt thou thy ſelf, ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing to thy Nets, as if by thy wit or worth thou couldſt adde one cubit to thy ſtature, one mite to thy millions, one grain to thy graces? <hi>Without me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15. And, <hi>without God,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>you can have nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 4. What ſaith the Pſalmiſt? <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it: and except the Lord keep the city, the watchmen watch in vain,</hi> Pſalm 127. And whom the pride of heart promoteth, though they ſhould make their neſt as high as the Eagle, the Lord will bring them down thence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 49.16. <hi>Yea, though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds, yet he ſhall periſh for ever like his own dung,</hi> verſ. 6, 7. Do not then in
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170448:127"/>your endowments, ſay thus: <hi>I have gotten by the might of my power;</hi> but look up rather to God, who hath ſo poured out his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings on us, that we ſhould remember to give up our bleſſings to him, prayſing and magnifying his holy Name, <hi>that he may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſee in Nature, that the greatneſs of enjoyments infer the loweſt condeſcenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the more the Tree is laden with Fruit, the lower it bends to the ground. Hence it is, that many come ſhort of honour, though it be moſt mens aime, becauſe they would aſcend to be honoured, without deſcending to be humbled. The old Romans, in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one Temple to <hi>Vertue,</hi> and another to <hi>Honour,</hi> conjoyned them in ſuch ſort, as none could enter into that of Honour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he firſt made a paſſage through this of Vertue. In like manner 'tis Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, that none be exalted in his upper Courts, but ſuch as contentedly ſubmit to ſtoop and paſs through the low wicket, and narrow door of Humility here below. This is exemplified in little and lowly <hi>David,</hi> whoſe Humility tranſlated him from the Sheep-fold to the high ſeat of Princes; yea, of the Princes of his people. We confeſs, every one that is humble, doth not here with <hi>Saul,</hi> finde a Kingdom, while he is ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fathers Aſſes, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. Yet many mean Apprentiſes, who have endured the heat of the day, and the drudgery of the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170448:128"/>night, have been advanced to the Skarlet and golden Chain of a Lord Maior; and ſure 'tis within the memory of man, that poor Scholars have aſcended to be Lord-Biſhops.</p>
            <p>But this exaltation of the lowly, is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by degrees; for though God be ever the ſame in himſelf, yet he is not always ſo in us; though he loves his beloved to the end, yet his love hath ſome intermiſſion. And this he doth in his infinite wiſdom; for the withholding of that we deſire, encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth our deſire; the more we ſtay for it, the more we long after it. We commonly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know the benefit of a thing, but by the abſence of it; our health would not be ſo much eſteemed, if it pleaſed not the Lord we were ſometimes ſick. The long abſence of a Friend, makes him the more welcome at his return. Thus the onely wiſe Diſpoſer of all things, oft times delays his Mercies, ſubſtracts his Comforts, withdraws his gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Preſence, to the end we may know our ſelves, and ſeek after him with greater fervency and devotion. The humble have their croſſes, but they are onely for the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of their Vertues. What if we be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled under the mighty hand of God? the ſame hand which ſmote us, ſhall make us whole, and lift us up; and that <hi>in D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All things have a time, orderly things a <hi>due</hi> time. In beſtowing his Mercy, the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170448:128"/>Lord regards the circumſtance ſo well as the ſubſtance; not onely in time, but in <hi>due time.</hi> That's the grace of a favour, to do it oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely, orderly, and conveniently, in a <hi>due</hi> time. Food and Phyſick given in due ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, proſper well; but the moſt neceſſary of theſe out of due time, doth hurt rather then help. God hath this gracious attribute among the reſt, <hi>He is a preſent help in time of need,</hi> Pſam 9.9. (That is) he performs it in extremity; then, when the minde of him who is in affliction, doth moſt greedily co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vet and deſire it. <hi>To every thing,</hi> Eccleſ. 3.1. <hi>there is an appointed time;</hi> whatſoever is done, ſuffered, enjoyed, whether natural, voluntary, or involuntary, it hath a ſet time wherein 'tis beautiful and comely. And though long, yet at length every promiſe, every threat, every prediction, ſhall come to his juſt period and performance. So 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in <hi>Habakkuk</hi> the ſecond, <hi>The viſion is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it ſhall ſpeak and not lye: though it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it ſhall ſurely come, it will not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It is the madneſs of the world, not to ſtay the time God hath deſigned, but they muſt ſtreight have their longings. Good <hi>Moſes</hi> was overtaken thus, expoſtulating with the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. <hi>Since I came to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh to ſpeak in thy Name, he hath vexed this people more, and yet thou haſt not delivered thy people at all:</hi> He thought it much to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Gods due time. In like manner the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170448:129"/>ſouls of thoſe that lye under the Altar, cry'd, <hi>Lord, how long? thou art holy, and juſt, and true; doſt thou not judge, avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?</hi> Revelations the ſixth. But they received anſwer, They <hi>muſt reſt for a ſeaſon, till the fulneſs of time.</hi> Nothing befalls us, but in Gods time; which we muſt attend, not preſcribe. In the one hundred twenty ninth <hi>Pſalm,</hi> God ſuffered evil men to plow the Church, and ſo make long Furrows on the back of it; Yet, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>the Lord will cut the cords of the wicked:</hi> their plow ſhall have no more traces to be drawn with. The Church may be given over to be vexed and tormented for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeaſon; but when the holy One hath done his work, when he hath ſufficiently corrected his people to their amendment, then he breaks the cords, the traces, and bonds aſunder.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites groan'd a long time under <hi>Pharaohs</hi> burdens; but when four hundred and thirty years were full, the period which God ſet, the fit time; then, upon the very ſame day, they were delivered, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> utterly deſtroyed, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12.41. There's a clear place for this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.35. Where, ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Enemies of the Church, 'tis ſaid, <hi>His foot ſhall ſlide in due time.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may complaine and think it too long, but 'tis not too long; if it were any ſooner, it would be too ſoon. <hi>In D<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E time his foot ſhall ſlide: Yet a little while, and he
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170448:129"/>that ſhall come, will come, and will not tarry,</hi> Heb. 10. That is, he will not tarry a jot beyond the due time and ſeaſon that is fitteſt. When bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> the Mother of the Lord, would have had him to turn water into wine, he tell'd her ſhe muſt ſtay her time, <hi>for my hour is not yet come,</hi> John 2. <hi>(i.)</hi> The hour wherein it might be more acceptable, and the miracle more profitable for them, for whoſe ſakes the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin deſired it to be done. So though he exceedingly loved <hi>Lazarus,</hi> yet he would not make ſuch haſt to help him, as was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>John</hi> 11. And why? even becauſe he who knew all things, knew this alſo, That when he was dead in his grave, the time was moſt fit,</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard of God, becauſe thereby to him would accrue the greater glory.</p>
            <p>Secondly, in reſpect of Chriſt himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by ſuch an extraordinary Act, he ſhould the more ſoundly confute and confound the Jews. And beſides, his Diſciples, through this Miracle, were the more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed in their belief. Wherefore, in the midſt of our preſſures and calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, let us abide cheerfully, and comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably look for Gods due time. For the All-ſufficient helps at a pinch; when all help failes, then is he ſeen. Doth <hi>Jacob</hi> want bread at home?
<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> then <hi>Joſeph</hi> is heard of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. Though he would not deliver <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> from the tempeſt,
<note place="margin">Jonas 2.</note> he did from the Whales
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170448:130"/>belly. The greater the danger was, the more his glory.</p>
            <p>The better to win you to wait Gods leaſure, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, bethink your ſelves how many a long look God hath made for us.
<note place="margin">Rev. 2.</note> Hath he not ſtood at our Doors knocking and calling, till his head was full of dew,
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.</note> and his locks full of the drops of the night? Forty dayes he ſtaid for <hi>Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve, Jonas</hi> the third. Forty years for <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> Pſalm the ninety fifth; and a Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for <hi>England.</hi> How much more then ſhould we wait on him, till he will have mercy; ingeminating our prayers for help, until he heales our bones, ſince he hath promiſed that he <hi>will riſe and have mercy upon Zion?</hi> Pſalm 102.</p>
            <p>VVe now, O Lord, humble our ſelves before thee, in praying to thee, and by a thankful Remembrance of thy Meritorious dying for us.</p>
            <p>Now therefore exalt us in thy ſtrength, refreſh our ſouls with the Comforts of thy holy Spirit, that we may glorifie thy holy Name, truſt in thy promiſes, and hope in thy Mercies, through Chriſts Merits; to whom, with thee and the holy Spirit, be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed all Honour and Glory, be rendered all praiſe and thankſgiving, ſervice and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, from Generation to Generation.

            <p>
               <note place="margin">SERM. XV.</note>THeſe words, though few in number, are in meaning large: Take them Hiſtorically, ſo they are a ſhort Creed: Take them Figuratively, ſo they contain the myſtery of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: Take them Morally, ſo they ſum up the practick end of all our preaching. Thus, as I conceive, they ſet forth unto us, a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Incarnation of our Saviour; His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation in the VVomb, in the Euchariſt, in the Life of a Chriſtian. One way he is incarnate by himſelf alone; the ſecond way he is oft made fleſh by our ſubordinate Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, that is, ſacramentally; and a third way he is to be made fleſh by your tractable duty. The Hiſtorical ſenſe I have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore examined, and by command, 'twas made publickly extant. Therein I ſhewed three members growing out of the Text; the Perſon Aſſuming, the Nature Aſſumed, and the Manner of the Union. The Perſon Aſſuming, the VVord, the ſecond Perſon of the Deity; the Nature Aſſumed, Humane, by the Name of <hi>Fleſh;</hi> the Manner of Union, ſecretly and wonderfully wrought, not by
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:170448:131"/>carnal generation, not by converſion, or mixture of ſubſtance, but by meer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; <hi>The Word was MADE fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſum of the firſt member was this: That by the Name of <hi>Word,</hi> the Son of God, or Gods inward Conception and pure Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was here ſignified; (for a Spirit hath naturally no other Son but ſuch) and that he was ſignified by the Name <hi>Word</hi> more properly and perſonally then by any other. More properly then by the Name <hi>Son;</hi> for that name is common to <hi>Adam, Luk.</hi> 3.28. and doth not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh from the uncleanly and material birth of Creatures. Likewiſe that he is named by <hi>Word</hi> more perſonally then by <hi>Light, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Image,</hi> which without ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Adjunct,</hi> agrees to other perſons of the Deity.</p>
            <p>From the ſecond Member, this is the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,</hi> That the incomprehenſible <hi>Word</hi> took Fleſh to become ſenſible: that he ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted himſelf for our Salvation, which could not be wrought by taking any but humane fleſh, the ſame that offended. <hi>Fleſh,</hi> mans wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer part, as well as the better, to ſave him wholly. True fleſh, to ſave him indeed. Fleſh in general, to ſave many; not fleſh reſtrained to a particular humane, but eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a divine Perſon. That ſuch genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was moſt congruous with his all-ſprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Divinity; that the Comfort thereof extended the Capacity of Salvation to us
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:170448:131"/>Gentiles and Sinners, as well as to the Jews; that fleſh being ſo contemptible and vile, and yet taken by Chriſt the Natural Son of God, was alſo a Motive to Humility. The Contents of the laſt member were theſe; That his temporal or ſecond Conception, was meerly a making; not humane genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion joyn'd with carnal Knowledge, but a ſecret over-ſhadowing and workmanſhip of God, joyn'd with the Virgins: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it was pure in it ſelf, and fit to cleanſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: That this making was no conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion either of <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Fleſh,</hi> no mixture of both, but onely a diſtinct reception of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, into the perſonal ſubſiſtence of the Deity: That there aroſe from this U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, an ample transfuſion of Royal gifts and prerogatives, whereby the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was highly advanced; and likewiſe by that Nature, our humane Perſons, who, by this means, have a near Conſanguinity with God, and great hope by that Conſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>Thus much Hiſtorically, for your conſtant belief: I will now proceed to touch the ſame Text ſacramentally, for your future benefit; for in the Sacrament alſo the <hi>Word</hi> is made Fleſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Word</hi> is now to be taken in another ſenſe, not ſubſtantially for the Perſon of Chriſt, but effectively, for the word by him ſpoken, the word of Conſecration, firſt pronounced by our Saviour, and afterwards by us: Or
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170448:132"/>elſe for a further effect of that word, grace conveyed by Chriſts Inſtitution, and our Miniſtry, into a ſacramental body. And then for the <hi>Word</hi> made fleſh, you have grace made meat; grace, the beam of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head in bread, the Deputy of his Fleſh and Man-hood; which if ye eat religiouſly with a believing ſoul, as well as naturally with a digeſting body, not onely as bread, but as a Sacrament, then <hi>eat and live,</hi> be <hi>as gods in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,</hi> knowing good without evil. For then the bread is not more really converted into your fleſh for bodily ſtrength, then the fleſh of Chriſt is truly united to your ſouls for the ſtrength of the Spirit; truly united, not by the identity of Nature onely, ſo it was before, but by lively Operation. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation made the Sacrament true, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament makes the incarnation beneficial. For Sacraments are not onely ſolemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and ſignificant Commemorations of Chriſts death; but exhibitive Conduits of Life to us; through which, if they be not ſtopt by our own wilful or negligent faith, grace will conſtantly flow.</p>
            <p>Many ſimilitudes there are betwixt theſe two Nativities: Though that were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in a Stable, and this in a temple; yet commonly in both places Chriſt is laid in a Manger, a duſty filthy Manger; elſe the beaſts cannot feed about him, profane Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaſts, barbarouſly ſluttiſh through pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed purity, exceſſively proud through Chriſts
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170448:132"/>humility. As there the <hi>Word</hi> was true God, ſo here he is true grace; as there he was perfect man, ſo here he is perfect bread, bread indeed, the true ſtaff of Life; tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiated into fleſh, I will not ſay, nor conſubſtantiate with fleſh, (for what need this?) but the body of Chriſt ſo truely preſent, (though I know not fully how) that you may ſafely call the conſecrated bread, the body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Againe, as the <hi>Word</hi> did not aſſume any particular humane perſon, but fleſh in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; ſo grace is here annexed to general bread; general, for the many grains where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was made, to ſignifie the Unity of fit Receivers: general for the making, it may be ordinary and uſual bread, to ſignifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency of the Receivers, any Gentile of any eſtate, any well-diſpoſed Chriſtian, may come and welcome.</p>
            <p>Beſides, as the <hi>Word</hi> was not converted into fleſh by the Union there; ſo grace is not here tranſcorporated into bread; the meer bodily eating will not ingratiate. One touch of faith was once more medicinable, and may be ſtill, then either was the throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rude multitude to our Saviour,
<note place="margin">Mat 9.</note> or the groſs eating of him can be to you.</p>

One main difference I find: Chriſt was then lodg'd in a pure Virgin, but our vile Carcaſſes have been deflowr'd or defil'd with divers fleſhly and worldly luſts. What ſhall we ſay then?

            <p>This inſtruction in one reſpect is like the <hi>Ant</hi>'s proviſion, to be laid up againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeaſon. Providence may lay it up, but folly, I fear, will be the Keeper: what ſay the Many, the Multitude? It need not be uſed till <hi>Eaſter.</hi> How are we fall'n from the Primitive Zeal towards this heavenly food? the time hath been when it was <hi>dayly bread;</hi> and need not we pray it were permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be made ſo now? The ſad face of theſe <hi>warring</hi> times being drawn with as deep a <hi>ſhadow</hi> as that. But men, for the moſt part; uſe it ſcarce <hi>yearly;</hi> and by their wills, take it once in an age; juſt when they are dying, then they call for the means of good living; and when they can ſin no more; they think of repentance and pardon; ſo condemning all their former life, by their own judgment and act at laſt.</p>
            <p>But be it <hi>ſadly</hi> conſidered; is this a ſound reaſon to excuſe our backwardneſs, I am not in Charity, I am clogg'd with weights of ſin,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170448:134"/>or I have ſome luſts to be fulfilled? Then ſay likewiſe, I am ſick, and therefore unapt to take Phyſick; I have ſoars upon me, and therefore will touch no Plaiſter; I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtarv'd, and therefore will eat no bread: But ſay others, this Phyſick, this Plaiſter, and this Food, if not rightly us'd, is dangerous and deadly: ſo is prayer, ſo is preaching, ſo is thy common bread, ſo is every thing which God hath given for our welfare: but as evil is not to be committed for love of good; ſo is not good to be omitted, for fear of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil.</p>
            <p>Wherefore invert thy frigid reaſon, and endeavour to draw neer: do not forbear becauſe thou art in malice, but force thy ſelf to be in Charity, that thou maiſt communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate. Do not hug thy ſin, and complain it makes thee unfit, leſt thou be found to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that ſin before Chriſt; but rather re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it with thy heart, and Chriſt is ready to be received. If ſtill thou think thy ſelf unworthy, know, that ſo to think, is the beſt part of thy worthineſs.</p>
            <p>Let the words I have ſpoken concerning the enlivening of this <hi>God-uniting</hi> myſtery, both excite your appetite of receiving the ſubſtance, and inſtruct your devotion in the manner of receiving it. Then theſe things which I have delivered, being rightly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at the ſacramental Incarnation, you ſhall ſoon be well gone with a third Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170448:134"/>even the <hi>Moral,</hi> which is to be ripen'd by a religious and dutiful practiſe of Chriſts holy precepts. For thus in <hi>Morality,</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> is alſo made fleſh; which is the third ſenſe propoſed.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Word,</hi> I ſay, is made fleſh, as before <hi>ſubſtantially</hi> in the Womb, when Chriſt came down to us; and then <hi>effectively</hi> in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, where he meets us half way: ſo now <hi>affectively</hi> in our Chriſtian <hi>morality,</hi> whereby we travel to him; and through which he deſcends to the heart, and there takes deeper hold; and ſtill by the ſame ſpiritual way, ſtill by an over-ſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt, and Mans obedient Faith.</p>
            <p>Take heed then <hi>how</hi> you hear, for <hi>Chriſt</hi> is in the Voice. As the <hi>Word</hi> in the Fleſh was ſpiritually conceived; ſo now in the ſound he cannot be conceived carnally, nor <hi>impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> a heart which is fill'd with unclean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. When that which you hear, is well digeſted, when it thrives and grows into bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily action, when the <hi>engrafted</hi> Word buds out, and brings forth fruit after the ſpiritual graft; then is the <hi>Word</hi> perfectly <hi>incarnate,</hi> then it hath gotten living Members <hi>maſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable</hi> to the beſt uſe; <hi>eyes</hi> to look up, <hi>knees</hi> to pray, <hi>hands</hi> to give, and a <hi>mouth</hi> to praiſe. See that ye thus uſe your Members.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Word</hi> be ſo prevalent in you, as to make you, ſubdue the unrulineſs of the fleſh to the Governance of the ſpirit, to drown
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:170448:135"/>the <hi>habit</hi> of exceſs in the <hi>Cup</hi> of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, to conſume the fire of luſt and the fire of ſtife with the fire of Devotion. If ye obſerve with all your power, a ſober, a clean, and Virgin-like behaviour, adding your <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at</hi> and obedient conſent to the VVord ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; <hi>Chriſt</hi> is much alike made fleſh in you, as in the pure and <hi>bleſſed Virgin.</hi> See you ſtrive to put this in practiſe.</p>
            <p>If, remembering the word of Chriſt, ye overcome the ſollicitous dotage of this world, with meditation of heavenly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and proceed to make friends of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous <hi>Mammon,</hi> ſcattering the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous <hi>duſt</hi> of your pockets, or <hi>doales</hi> of your basket, the <hi>Word</hi> is almoſt <hi>literally</hi> made fleſh; fleſh in thy <hi>hand,</hi> fleſh in him that <hi>is fed</hi> alſo; and He, whom thou feedeſt, is <hi>Chriſt. Me</hi> you fed,

            <p>But thoſe, thou wilt ſay, are tokens of a <hi>Moral, Foſter</hi>-parent, not of one that brings forth Chriſt <hi>indeed.</hi> Be it ſo; yet if Chriſt eſteemed his <hi>Moral,</hi> his <hi>Foſter</hi>-Parent bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then his <hi>Natural,</hi> as meerly natural, do thou eſteem ſo too.

               <hi>Behold my Mother,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:170448:135"/>my Brothers, and my Siſters:</hi> And as Chriſt ſpoke, ſo bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> thought of her ſelf, according to her wonted humility; for, ſaith the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Luk 2.19.</note> ſhe laid up <hi>his ſayings in her heart.</hi> She had not ſo much of him already, but that ſhe needed a further Conception: Better it was to bear him in <hi>ſoul,</hi> then to have born him in <hi>body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, great reſemblance there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt bearing, and true hearing. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> communicates the acts of the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>breeding, faſhioning, travel: My Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, I am in travel againe till Chriſt be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhioned within you,</hi> Gal. 4.19. VVhen the <hi>Word</hi> begins to <hi>curdle,</hi> and <hi>qualms</hi> come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Conſcience, then is Chriſt a <hi>bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding;</hi> when godly purpoſes are conceived, Chriſt is a <hi>faſhioning;</hi> when our bowels <hi>yearn</hi> with heavenly longings for execution, then we are in <hi>travel</hi> with Chriſt; and when we come to <hi>action,</hi> Chriſt is <hi>delivered;</hi> yet ſtill remaining within. Wilt thou farther know how he lives within? Even as thou doſt, by <hi>Motion, Heat,</hi> and <hi>Food:</hi> By <hi>Motion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> in love of heavenly things; <hi>down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> in fear of infernal: by <hi>Heat</hi> alſo, that of Zeal and Devotion: by <hi>Food</hi> likewiſe, continual ſupply of the <hi>word,</hi> which repairs what ſin hath waſted; and not without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining digeſting faculty, which turns the food to nouriſhment, to growth, and fruit.</p>
            <p>Yet Chriſt, when he was upon the earth,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:170448:136"/>did not live upon the <hi>Word</hi> onely, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times on bread. Feed him now with bread alſo, not onely with that bread which thou receiveſt in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> ſometimes with that thou ſhoudlſt give to others; <hi>to others,</hi> that thy ſelf may'ſt live in Chriſt, and <hi>He</hi> in thee.</p>
            <p>VVhy did the Woman cry out, <hi>BLES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SED is the Womb that bare thee,
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.27.</note> and the Breſts that gave thee ſuck?</hi> What need of a <hi>Womb,</hi> when thou haſt a <hi>fruitful</hi> heart?

               <hi>Beloved,</hi> there is not a woman, nor a Virgin, no nor a man here, but by ſome kind or other, by obeying the Goſpel, may be the <hi>Mother</hi> of Chriſt, his bleſſed <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and, if you believe the Prophet, may have breaſts to give him ſuck.

The unſetled multitude was herewith amaz'd, verſ. 23.

Yet becauſe ſometimes a diſeaſed Phyſitian may preſcribe healthſome phyſick, and a deform'd Engraver carve a fair pourtraiture; I truſt God will bleſs theſe my weak endeavours, while for my own and your good, I have made my ſelf a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Remembrancer</hi> to prepare our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular accounts againſt the coming of the Lord.

            </p>
            <p>It's well ſtated by the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,</hi> that words were ordained to ſet forth Gods <hi>glory,</hi> mans <hi>gratitude,</hi> and to keep up <hi>civil</hi> commerce.

Shall the God of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, whoſe mercy is over and above all his works, be ſo ſevere as to call us to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for theſe ſmaller trifles? If our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our literally ſignified, that our <hi>idle</hi> words, ſins of ſo mean a quality, ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by ſuch a fiery tryal; how is it that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks to <hi>Ananias, God ſhall ſmite thee, thou whited wall?</hi> Act. 23.

               </gap> ſawcy jeſting, which is wont to be <hi>nick-nam'd</hi> pleaſant conceit.

            <p>Hence is it, that Chriſt, the right Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of his Fathers will, gives us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in the fifteenth of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> that to be angry without a cauſe, to ſay <hi>Racha,</hi> Thou emptybrain, Thou fool, Piſh, or the like

            <p>The truth is, the fault lies in the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, ſelf-ſeeking, levelling Spirits, who chuſe rather to <hi>ſcarrifie,</hi> then cloſe our wounds; caſting Coals, and kindling ſtrife betwixt the <hi>ſupream</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate,</hi> that the whole <hi>Nation</hi> may be ſet on flame and in Combuſtion.

               <pb n="274" facs="tcp:170448:142"/>in the tongue, but onely by ſympathy and conſent with an ill diſpoſed heart. As we ſee the head may ſuffer pain and anguiſh, not ſo much from any obnoxious quality inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in it, as from the fumes ariſing out of a diſtempered and foul ſtomach. For words, as conſiſting of Letters and ſyllables, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different in their own nature; they are made guilty, as they ſpeak the temper of that breaſt from whence they flow. <hi>Index est Animi ſermo,</hi> ſpeech is the Character, the Stamp, the Image of the Mind; and ſo may juſtly be puniſhed for its bad meſſage, as a guiltleſs <hi>Embaſſadour</hi> may be evil entreated, becauſe his <hi>Errand</hi> diſtaſted. In reſpect of the concurrence and mutual correſpondence betwixt the heart and tongue, our thoughts are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, words of the <hi>mind.</hi> We read in the ſeventh of Saint <hi>Luke, Simon</hi> ſaid <hi>within</hi> himſelf; his think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was ſpeaking. Our thoughts indeed, for want of the tongues forming and <hi>articula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> are not audible to the ears of man; yet God underſtands their Language, he hears what we think. In the twenty fifth verſe of this Chapter, <hi>Jeſus,</hi> knowing their <hi>thoughts,</hi> ſaid unto them: He diſcerns the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ellion of our imaginations, the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our affections; and if they be not raz'd out of the book of his <hi>remembrances,</hi> by the grace of Repentance, he will judge them accordingly. So that we had need to call our idle thoughts to examination, as well
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:170448:142"/>as our idle words; otherwiſe one day they will both be brought to tryal. Before the Lord, evil thoughts are as much ſins as evil deeds; as much perhaps, though not as great. Wherefore as Chriſt was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, and bruiſed for our iniquities:
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.</note> ſo he was delivered <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, even for our <hi>ſlips,</hi> as the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal expreſſeth it in the fourth to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> and the laſt Verſe.</p>
            <p>This ſhould make us tremble at Gods judgements due to our very trifling <hi>lapſes,</hi> ſince for theſe alſo our Saviour ſhed his precious blood: we can be ſo favourable to our ſelves, as to think the deſire onely to do a good work, though there want ability to do it, is as well accepted with God, as if it were done. And we muſt know too, that the contrary is as true; the deſire of any iniquity is as odious to the Omniſcient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, as the Act of Commiſſion is. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Saint <hi>John,</hi> 1 <hi>Epiſt. chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. makes hatred of the heart, murther before God. So that our conſcience ſhould be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted at each petty puny offence; for one errour may multiply into many. <hi>Solon,</hi> as <hi>Plutack</hi> reports, reproving <hi>Theſpis</hi> a Poet, for lying in his Play, <hi>Theſpis</hi> anſwered, It was not material to do or ſay ſuch things, conſidering all was but in ſport. Yea, but reply'd <hi>Solon,</hi> if we commend lying in ſport, we ſhall find it afterwards in good earneſt. <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is the <hi>Word,</hi> delights in our words
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170448:143"/>when they are conformable to his will; and therefore Satan, to croſs him therein, makes the firſt open entrance into irregular courſes upon trivial occaſions, as <hi>idle words,</hi> which may ſerve to bring on, and uſher in more outragious evils. For the unclean Spirit, having once inſinuated and got entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l eaſily introduce ſeven other <hi>Spirits,</hi> nay, a <hi>Legion,</hi> worſe then himſelf. Let it then be our diſcretion and religion, to ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle and ſuppreſs ill motions in the womb ſo ſoon as conceived; for if we ſuffer them to ripen into idle words, they may prove the ſhame and deſtruction of the Speaker. To make the account exact, every <hi>farthing</hi> muſt be expreſſed; and ſo in the ſtrict ſeverity of Gods Juſtice, not onely our crying ſins, but <hi>idle</hi> words, and <hi>vain</hi> thoughts, will be ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up, if they be not waſhed out by relen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting tears. Whence 'tis clear, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigning our ſelves at the Bar of our own Conſcience in this life, is the onely way to be acquitted hereafter through our <hi>ſurety,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. For God loves to behold his Juſtice prevented, by our accuſing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning our ſelves, as being unwilling his laſt deſtructive ſentence of execution, ſhould be ſerved upon our perſons: yet take this <hi>Caution</hi> along alſo, If we call not our ſelves to account in this time of <hi>Truce,</hi> but leave God to do it at the general <hi>Audit</hi> of all fleſh, Mercy is then out of <hi>date,</hi> there's
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170448:143"/>no more parleying, but utter defiance; bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoul, both will be forfeited without any <hi>Reprieve</hi> from eternal death: which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers me to the circumſtance of time, when this account is compleatly to be made, <hi>at the day of judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there ſhall be a <hi>general</hi> Judgment, is granted by the very Devils, who, in the eighth of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> are ſaid to believe and tremble at the fearful expectation of it. The Knowledge whereof in the general is imparted to us here, that the <hi>Terror</hi> of the Lord might not overtake us like a violent ſtorm, not to be prevented, becauſe not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen.

Again, this day of Judgement is ſaid to be the <hi>laſt day:</hi> Firſt, to demonſtrate Gods fatherly Tenderneſs over his <hi>Elect;</hi> many of them are yet unconverted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, therefore his goodneſs ſtaies till their number be accompliſhed.

Our account is likewiſe poſted off till <hi>the day of Judgment,</hi> to declare the bountifulneſs and patience of the Lord, which waits from year to year to ſee if at the laſt we will return to him in a true reconciliation. And here's great inquiſition of the <hi>certain</hi> time when the Judgement-day ſhall be. It's common in every mouth, how the <hi>Jews</hi> had a prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that the world ſhould continue ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years; two thouſand before the Law, two thouſand under the Law, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand under the Goſpel.

            <p>Indeed, when I reflect on <hi>this iron age,</hi> wherein <hi>Pandora's</hi> boxes are open'd to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man-kind, Satan is broke looſe in glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing lying tongues, which nouriſh diviſions from <hi>Dan to Beerſheba:</hi> though I cannot ſay they are ſignes of Chriſts immediate preſent coming to judge the univerſal world; yet they may preſage, that the god of this world hath ſo puzzled the underſtanding of ſuch as are ſeduced, that they cannot ſee how he projects that the particular private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>GIve me leave to ſignifie in all meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, you are not to expect <hi>London</hi>-meaſure, extended prolixity; I e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver minded the ſtrength, not length of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; my endeavours tending to ſpeak much in little, not little in much: My diſcourſe, I doubt not, will prove ſeaſonable on this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary</hi> Meeting, although I have not choſen, according to my wont, an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conſonant and ſutable to the day. The ancient <hi>Rubrick</hi> of the Church, makes the whole buſineſs of this day to be of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt:</hi> I follow not that direction now, to prevent miſpriſion of captious times, and becauſe I hold this Text more uſeful for your Audience, which treats not of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> but of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſt;</hi> it was he to whom Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Behold thy Mother;</hi> and he was the Diſciple, who from that hour took her to his own home.</p>
            <p>To diſpel and clear ſome miſts hovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Text, which otherwiſe may cloud and darken your underſtanding, conſider
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:170448:147"/>that our Saviour was now in extremity of pain and torment on the Croſs; the whole outward man was battered, and every part beſieged with a diſtinct death; he felt his Fathers Arrows ſticking in his holy ſides, drinking up his innocent blood for our tranſgreſſions; yet when in the midſt of his Agony, he ſaw his dear Mother and beloved Diſciple ſtanding near the Croſs, as one regardleſs of the Gall and Bitterneſs of his own ſufferings, of the pricking anguiſh in his hands and feet by the Nails, in a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy his heart yearns and commiſerates his Mothers miſery, whoſe ſoul was now pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with the ſword of Sorrow. His Zeal had a ſmart ſenſe of the wants ſhe might be expoſed to after his deceaſe; and therefore caſting a loving glance on the Virgin and Diſciple, he ſaith to his Mother, <hi>Behold thy Son,</hi> verſe 26. and here to the Diſciple, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold thy Mother.</hi> Now we are not to faſten on the Rind and Bark of the Letter; the words are to be underſtood in a ſound ſenſe, and <hi>cum grano ſalis.</hi> It cannot be conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bleſſed Virgin, bleſſed <hi>among</hi> women, bleſſed <hi>above</hi> women, ſhould have <hi>John</hi> for the natural iſſue of her womb: St. <hi>Matthew, chap.</hi> 4. doth catechiſe us, that <hi>John</hi> was the Son of <hi>Zebedeus;</hi> but by theſe endearing appellations of <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Mother,</hi> our Saviour ſignifies his meaning was, that Diſciple ſhould as much ſet by her, have her in as high eſtimation, as if from her bowels he came breathing into the world.</p>

               </gap>, it is not ſufficient to keep them alive, and yet will not ſuffer them to dye. Excellent perſons to make Scribes and Phariſees of! They taught the people to anſwer their indigent impotent Parents craving help in their neceſſity, by ſaying, 'Tis <hi>Corban,</hi> Mar. 7.11. <hi>(i.)</hi> they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſtributed to pious and charitable uſes, and ſo had done enough; ſtood diſcharg'd before God; no further thing to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at their hands; leaving them from whom they received their lives, to ſtarve and periſh. But Chriſt tell'd them there, in ſtead of Gods Commandments, they taught their own traditions. The Ethnicks will riſe up in Judgment againſt ſuch flint-hearted wretches. <hi>Valerius Maximus</hi> hath ſet down a remarkable ſtory of a Daughter, who viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting her Father in Priſon, condemned there to dye by Famine, prolong'd his life by foſtering him with the Milk of her breaſts; which being diſcovered to the Magiſtrate, the Reſult was an applauſe of the Daughter, and a releaſe of the Father.

Bellarmine,</hi> in his <hi>Opuſcula,</hi> I hope you will not ſtart at the words of an Adverſary, where they have a tendency to inflame true devotion, brings in Chriſt thus ſpeaking of his holy Mother: I took but one life, my humane life, of my Virgin Mother; yet for that one, I gave to her three lives: I gave to her a humane life,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:170448:149"/>when together with the Father and the holy Spirit, I created her: For he made all things, <hi>and without him was made nothing that was made,</hi> John 1.3. I gave her the life of grace, in that I quickn'd and regenerated her with my Spirit. I gave to her alſo the life of glory, in that I dyed for her, to the intent ſhe might not periſh, but have life eternal. I carefully provided for her in my life and death. What a ſpur ſhould this be to the <hi>naturalneſs of our love?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8.8.</note> How ſhould it ſummon all our parts to help our Parents, as we be able, if neceſſity require? Though we ſtrive to do the utmoſt we can do, and what we cannot do, we ſhall never requite the expence, the moleſtation, the homely offices they have ſuſtained in our minority, nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and education. It ſeems Saint <hi>John</hi> was of this perſwaſion; for ſo ſoon as Chriſt bid him to behold the Virgin as his Mother, that <hi>engaging</hi> title wrought ſo upon him, that like a regardful Son, forthwith he obeys the charge, <hi>and from that hour took her to his own home.</hi>

When Chriſt call'd on <hi>Zacheus</hi> in the <hi>Syca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more</hi>-Tree, to come down, and to prepare for his entertainment at his own home; Saint <hi>Luke</hi> records it in the nineteenth chapter, and the ſixth verſe, that he made <hi>haſte,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving him not repiningly, but joyfully. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> upon <hi>Chriſts</hi> firſt call, left their Nets, and immediately followed him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. Whatſoever thou takeſt in hand, <hi>inſtanter operare,</hi> Eccles. 9.10. ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, quickly, inſtantly do it with all thy power and might; for true Devotion is of a ſprightly readineſs, leſt its inward fervency or zeal, by delay, wax cold and neglectful. Had the Apoſtle made a demur, conſulted with fleſh and blood, the worldling would have rounded him in the ear, that this was a Legacy utterly to be rejected. Indeed, a gift of gain both hands may be open to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, but the bequeathing a neceſſitous mother to your maintaining, is a buſineſs of another nature; 'tis a hard <hi>province,</hi> and who will undertake it to his certain loſs? Muſt you of all others be commended into this charge and trouble? Such would have
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:170448:150"/>been the Plea of a carnal churliſh <hi>Nabal.</hi> But <hi>Eagle-eyed John</hi> viewed theſe ſubluna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſpects as things below him. His De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion flies upward, looks ſtedfaſtly on the Son of Righteouſneſs, conſiders he cannot do too much for ſuch a Maſter, who before the reſt, own'd him for the beſt beloved Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple; and to ſignifie the confidence he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in him above all others, would truſt none with the care of his Mother, but him alone. And ſo out of a thankful mind, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven preſently takes her to his cuſtody; and that not for the date or term of ſet years by covenant, but freely, ſo long as ſhe lived; which, if you will give credence to <hi>Nicepho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi>'s <hi>Legend,</hi> was the ſpace of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leven or twelve years from that hour of Chriſts death.</p>
            <p>This religious fact, and continued fidelity of <hi>John,</hi> ſhould rouze all <hi>Trustees,</hi> to whom is appointed the diſpoſing of the ſubſtance of the dead, to be conſtantly honeſt, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their truſt. The neglect whereof hath cool'd the Zeal of many enclined to libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, cauſing them to withdraw the Oyl from their ſhining and burning Lamps; it being voyc'd to be a common fault, an accuſtom'd manner to pervert and ſubvert the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors ſenſe and meaning, whereby ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd for <hi>Executors,</hi> are reproachfully bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>Executioners</hi> of Wills.

               <note place="margin">Iſai. 22.23.</note> as the Prophet phraſeth it. You have given a good example, but 'tis <hi>copyed</hi> out byfew.

Read the thirty fifth Chapter of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and mark how God rewarded the <hi>Rechabites</hi> for their obedience to their Fathers will. <hi>I ſet,</hi> ſo ſpeaks the Prophet, <hi>before the children of Rechab, bottles full of Wine, and ſaid to them, Drink Wine. But they ſaid, We will not drink wine: for Jonadab our father com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us, ſaying, You ſhall drink no Wine, you nor your Sons for ever.</hi> Which they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, onely becauſe it was the will of their deceaſed Father. <hi>Therefore thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, Jonadab the Son of Rechab ſhall not want a man to ſtand before me,</hi> (i.) to be in my favour, <hi>for ever,</hi> verſe <hi>ult.</hi> Labour then to keep a good Conſcience, to deal juſty and uprightly before God our heavenly Father, and before men in all concernments impos'd upon us, and undertaken by us.

In the beginning of this verſe, it is not, Then he ſaid to <hi>ME, Behold thy Mother,</hi> but to the <hi>Diſciple</hi> whom he loved; and in the ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent words he ſaith not, <hi>I</hi> took her, but <hi>that Diſciple</hi> took her to his own home.

            <p>One might have thought that bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> Chriſts <hi>Mother,</hi> born of the blood <hi>Royal,</hi> for ſhe was naturally deſcended out of <hi>Davids Loyns,</hi> ſhould not be conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live by the Alms and Coſt of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple: That <hi>Joſeph,</hi> her betrothed Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, right heir to the Crown of <hi>Judah,</hi> ſhould not be brought ſo low, as to be fain to labour for his living.

            </p>
            <p>[To his own home.]</p>
            <p>And now after all this travail and pains, I am informed my labour is loſt, having fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a Caſtle in the Air, without any Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on the Earth. For in the <hi>Original</hi> 'tis ſimply and barely put down, <hi>He took her to his own:</hi> The bold Engliſh, who uſe to ſpeak out, have in their Tranſlation ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added <hi>houſe</hi> and <hi>home.</hi> The ground of this Variance is a ſtrange long miſtake of <hi>Peter</hi>'s
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:170448:153"/>words, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.27. becauſe there <hi>Peter,</hi> as <hi>Prolocutor</hi> for the reſt, ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>We have forſaken all, and followed thee;</hi> many of the <hi>Fathers</hi> (to whom God was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to reveale all Circumſtances) have tranſlated the Greek, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, from its proper to an improper ſignification. They will not have it ſo underſtood, as if <hi>John</hi> took her to his own poſſeſſion, (for by their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict he was one of thoſe who utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook all for Chriſts ſake) but that he took her to his <hi>own care,</hi> to help her the beſt he could out of the contributions of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> who lye at the lurch by too much ſubtilty, to make plain things obſcure, when it conduceth to their own intereſt, cry up this ancient interpretation as <hi>Catholique,</hi> and the contrary as <hi>Heretical;</hi> thereby in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, from the Apoſtles practiſe, to exalt the ſupererogating Vow of voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty. The <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> from hence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn propriety of Goods, as inconſiſtent with, or oppoſite to the Goſpel. So that it may ſeem I have undertaken a difficult pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, to juſtifie our Church in rendering Saint <hi>John</hi>'s taking the Virgin Mother to his own habitation.</p>
            <p>But I doubt not to demonſtrate to each diſcerning Spirit, that after their call to the <hi>Apoſtleſhip, John,</hi> with the reſt, had a propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in their Houſes, Moveables, Tenures, perſonal and real Eſtates. For though 'tis
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:170448:153"/>recorded they left all, yet 'twas in a qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſenſe; they left not all ſimply and wholly, but ſo far, and ſo long, as they might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments to their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Faith in Chriſt, or preaching the Goſpel, and no otherwiſe. They could at their pleaſure return to the poſſeſſion and uſe of what was theirs. This is confirmed, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.29. when they were come out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue, <hi>Jeſus</hi> entered into the <hi>houſe of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> with <hi>Andrew, James</hi> and <hi>John;</hi> where, after their deſertion of all, 'tis ſtill <hi>Simons houſe.</hi> So <hi>Matthew</hi> 4.14. he came into <hi>Peters houſe.</hi> The better to declare his Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, or challenging it for his own, he entertain'd Chriſt and his fellow Diſciples, with a banquet therein: So much is collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from verſe 31. which reſtifies that his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, newly by him recovered from a Fever, miniſtred to them. After this, as a wealthy Citizen of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> he paid Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute-Money, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.27. And which proves they mean'd no abſolute perpetual abnegation, abjuration, or renouncing of their temporalties, but onely a willing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtration from them, during their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Employments abroad for the ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of the <hi>Saints,</hi> the enlarging the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church; <hi>Peter, Joh.</hi> 21. after Chriſts Reſurrection, is named to have uſed the Ship and Nets as his peculiar. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> after his calling from the Receipt of Cuſtome, made Chriſt a great Feaſt in his
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:170448:154"/>own houſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.14. Now this <hi>Evangeliſt John</hi>'s Fortunes were greater then his fellow Fiſhers; it being obſerved, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.20. that he had Mercenary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Ship to attend his Father <hi>Zebe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,</hi> when, on Chriſts ſummons, he left them to wait on him. Were it not then a weak Collection, that he, of all the reſt, ſhould ſacrifice to the <hi>Goddeſs</hi>

            <p>Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> of no ſmall account in the Romiſh <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> foreſeeing ſuch a ſcandal, cites the <hi>Ancients</hi> aſſerting <hi>John</hi> to have <hi>held his houſe</hi> ſeated on the hill of Sion, and that for the nobleneſs of his deſcent, he was in great favour with <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the high Prieſt, to whom he made ſale of his Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories in <hi>Galilee.</hi> The beſt Criticks declare that <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Neither can there any thing in Scripture be found, which on juſt cauſe may be judg'd to contradict the truth hereof. Firſt, the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> do not relate they left all, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to teach us to vow mendicity, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace penury as a ſtate of perfection. If it had heen ſo, Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.11, 12. verſes, would not command us to work with our hands, that we may have lack of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: yea, if that were good Doctrine, how comes it to paſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. he wills every one to lay by him in ſtore, for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring to the Saints, as God had proſpered him?</p>
            <p>If we may ſtore up, and pleaſe God too, we need not to diſclaim our proper Goods, but rather to preſerve the materials of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that the Lord may be glorified through the liberal diſtributions of ſuch who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched in every thing to all bountifulneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.11. Whence I conceive that a godly wiſe man may deſire always to have all ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in all things,
<note place="margin">Verſ. 8. Verſ. 12.</note> as they are ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, neceſſary means to undertake great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and to make him abound to every good work, which cauſeth, through him, thankſgiving to the Lord.</p>
            <p>There being certain Vertues not practiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the poor, as this was of <hi>John</hi>'s ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the diſtreſſed Virgin; why doth the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſay, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. <hi>I know how to want,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:170448:155"/>and how to abound?</hi> But to inſtruct, if it pleaſe God to exerciſe his patience with ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering want, he was ready to ſerve him in all obedience; but if it ſeem'd meet to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wiſdom to furniſh him with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, he knew how to uſe it to the Glory of God with thankfulneſs.</p>
            <p>Beſides, the Authour and Finiſher of our Faith, who came into the world, that we, through his poverty, might be made rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. did not lead ſo baſe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did a life, as ſome pretend, but had a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of needful proviſions. For in <hi>John</hi> 13. we read it was <hi>Judas</hi> Office to keep the Bag, and disburſe his Caſh. The Diſciple <hi>Philip, John</hi> 6. makes a demand of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pence, as it were out of his Stock. In the ſecond of <hi>John,</hi> his Diſciples were ſent to buy meat out of his own purſe; to which end, the Diſciples thought in the thirteenth of <hi>John,</hi> verſe twenty nine, that Chriſt bid <hi>Judas</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> thoſe neceſſaries they had uſe of againſt a feſtival day. They talk'd, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. of <hi>ſelling</hi> the pretious Oyntment. All which are as Clouds of Witneſſes, that the <hi>Primitive</hi> times did not hold a voluntary dereliction of worldly wealth, a ſtate of greater <hi>perfection</hi> then others, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> impoſeth on the World, to magnifie the beggery of <hi>Capuchins, Hermits,</hi> and <hi>Anchorets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, 'tis againſt all reaſon, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> relinquiſhed all on this reſpect, that
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170448:155"/>'tis unlawful to retain any thing as our own peculiar. For God hath not created man to inherit the earth in common. 'Tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8. the moſt High <hi>divided</hi> the Nations their inheritance, he hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the Sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> And having commanded the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> to be <hi>divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> he gave in charge that the inheritances allotted, ſhould not be <hi>alienated</hi> from one <hi>Tribe</hi> to another: ſo that ſeveral and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct poſſeſſions are Gods Ordinance. When the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were come into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> every <hi>Tribe</hi> had his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion allotted by <hi>Joſhua.</hi> The tenth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment forbidding us to covet any thing that is our Neighbours, implies our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to have Goods peculiar to himſelf.</p>
            <p>Again, if ſuch as be rich had no right in their riches more then others, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would have ſo inſtructed them, and wiſh'd them to renounce their wealth: but his Counſel is, that they be not <hi>high-minded,</hi> that they do not <hi>truſt</hi> in <hi>uncertain</hi> riches, but in the living God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. It is not enjoying of our worldly Treaſure, but our ſetting our hearts on it, the inordinate love thereof, to the hinderance of our ſervice towards God, which we are utterly to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake. If the holding of Eſtates in private, had diſpleaſed the <hi>Almighty,</hi> then when <hi>Zacheus,</hi> upon his receiving Chriſt into his houſe, ſaid, <hi>Behold, Lord, half of my goods I give to the poor;</hi> Chriſt would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:170448:156"/>him for his poſſeſſions; but his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. <hi>This day is Salvation come to this Houſe.</hi> We read of others in the New Teſtament, who were full of goods; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> the <hi>Eunuch, Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, Tabitha,</hi> the women which followed Chriſt out of <hi>Galilee, Act.</hi> 21. Yet there's not any reprehenſion of them, or condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any propriety they enjoy'd. This <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptiſtical</hi> community, was an Opinion taught by <hi>Plato</hi> in his time. Afterwards the <hi>Hereticks</hi> call'd <hi>Apoſtolici,</hi> were of the ſame mind, becauſe 'tis written, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. <hi>they had all things common.</hi> But they did not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the community then was a neceſſary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, being dayly in danger by tyranny, to have all ſeiz'd and taken away violently. Beſides, 'twas not enforc'd by any Law, but they voluntarily tendered what they had; which cauſed <hi>Peter</hi> to anſwer <hi>Ananias,</hi> Act. 5. <hi>While it remained, was it not thy own?</hi> That which was ſold and made common, was not diſpoſed as every one pleaſed, but diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted according to their ſeveral neceſſities. Moreover, if no ſingle perſon hath any right to his Goods, what needed <hi>Naboth</hi> to keep ſuch ado about his Vineyard? It was not <hi>Ahab,</hi> but <hi>Naboth,</hi> that on this account was in jurious, by uſurping to himſelf what was not confirmed to him by a rightful Title. The eighth Commandment will be thought ſuperfluous: Can we be ſaid to ſteal that which I may as juſtly call mine, as thou
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:170448:156"/>thine? If <hi>propriety</hi> be not eſtabliſhed, Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeds will be uſeleſs, Family proviſions need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, forrein Merchandizing quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.

            <p>He that hath transferred the right thereof on thee, expects, in the managing and uſage, thou doſt communicate to the neceſſities of the Saints. If thou niggardly lock up that which is more then thou needſt, thou doſt injure Gods poor ones, who need more then they have. Should you ſay, If ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Object of Charity were preſented to you as Chriſts diſtreſſed <hi>Mother,</hi> you would readily ſacrifice your Eſtate to
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:170448:157"/>ſuſtain her?

            <p>Tenacious Miſers may pretend what they will; though we extol not good works ſo high as to make them to be the price of heaven, yet they are not to be reckoned ſo low, as if they availed nothing towards it. <hi>For we are Gods workmanſhip, created unto good works, which he hath prepared that we ſhould walk in them,</hi> Epheſ. 2.9, 10.

               </note> when a <hi>Right Reverend</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeer of Chriſts Flock, a learned Champion of the Truth, publiſhed in print not long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, he was forc'd to take care for his back and belly, when he ſhould be ſtudying the good of Souls. To come home to you: I deny not, but that this <hi>Metropolis,</hi> wherein you have improved your Eſtates, ought to partake of ſome ſignal token of your reſpect to it; yet the <hi>instinct,</hi> the Impreſſion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will prompt you to advance the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the Country of your Nativity: there your Charity ſhould ſtream forth in a full ſource, and extend it ſelf according to the meaſure of the line of your proportions. The County is of no large extent and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit;
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</note> yet 'tis greatn'd, in that it hath been

Do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from your <hi>Predeceſſors,</hi> who lived before you; be as vertuous and nobly minded as they were; honour the Lord with your Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as far as you are able, remembering he that ſoweth liberally, ſhall reap liberally, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.6. Fill the bellies of them, who are ready to ſtarve; clothe ſuch who ſtand ſhive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for want of rayment; apprentiſe ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Children who want ſupplies to be put to Trades; and be aſſured, all your love will be requited and returned ſevenfold into your own boſomes. <hi>He that giveth to the poor,

            <p>Now the Eternal, Inviſible, onely wiſe GOD, who doth all things accoridng to the Counſel of his own Will, give us Grace to be Charitable to our own Souls, by diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting out of our ſtore to the want of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; that neither the <hi>Moat,</hi> nor the <hi>Ruſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Canker</hi> of our <hi>Mammon,</hi> may endite us of unfruitful engroſſing the Lords Talents to <hi>Self-intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We beſeech him to enable us with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentfulneſs in all Eſtates, with cheerfulneſs in tribulations, with confidence in his ſaving help, though he ſhould ſlay us; that ſo when we are to leave our earthly home, we may be taken into his Coeleſtial Habitations, where with bleſſed <hi>Mary,</hi> devout <hi>John,</hi> and with all Gods Elect people, we ſhall worſhip and enjoy his beatifying Preſence in eternal holineſs and happineſs: which God grant us through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.
